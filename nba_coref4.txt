such as the drafting of draft bust Nikoloz Tskitishvili in 2002 and the sign-and-trade deal with the New Jersey Nets to acquire Kenyon Martin at the end of the 2003–04 season.Shortly following a

Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual spelling was decided by Dwyane Wade own mother.In 1977, JoLinda, at the age of 18, already had two children.Wade has described Wade upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult.Wade stated that "[Wade] mom was on drugs and [Wade] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can.When Wade was only 4 months old, Wade parents separated – and would later divorce.JoLinda was given custody of the two children, and JoLinda moved to JoLinda mother's house with the two children.the two children struggled financially, and it was around that time when JoLinda started dealing drugs.JoLinda mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine.JoLinda would get high with friends at JoLinda home, even in the presence of JoLinda children.In an interview with ESPN, Wade said "I've seen the needles laying around the house.I've seen my mother shoot up before.I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." At the age of 6, a kid recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding a kid home as they searched for a kid .When Wade turned 8 years old, Wade older sister, Tragil, tricked Wade – by telling Wade they were going to the movies – into living with Wade father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood.Wade would still occasionally visit Wade mom.A year later, Wade father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois.After moving to Robbins, Wade did not see Wade mother for two years.During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell someone who tests street drugs for impurities.JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after JoLinda mistakenly injected JoLinda with LSD.In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail.Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with Wade mom by talking with his mom at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone.JoLinda served 23 months in prison for his mom crimes, but while serving his mom second sentence in 1997, his mom failed to report to prison while on work release.Wade turned to sports, especially basketball and football, to avoid the temptations of participating in drug and gang-related activities.Wade's mom and dad would often take Wade to the park to play basketball.Wade cites one of Wade older sisters, Tragil, as the individual most responsible for Wade childhood upbringing and for steering Wade in the proper direction.As a child growing up in the Chicago area, Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan, and has said He patterns He game after He.Wade attended Harold L.Richards High School in Oak Lawn.Wade quickly found success as a wide receiver on the football team, but Wade needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during Wade junior year.While Wade did not acquire much playing time during Wade second year, Wade stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was the star of the varsity basketball team.Wade grew four inches in the summer before Wade junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game.The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading Wade team to a 24–5 record.It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional.During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season.Wade has stated that he high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, was one of the most positive influences in he life during this time.Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.During most of Wade's time at Marquette, Wade mother was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine.On October 14, 2001, JoLinda declared that his mother would change his mother life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church.Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas to be with his mom, who his believed was clean and sober for the first time in his life.However, JoLinda admitted to his that JoLinda was actually going back to prison.Wade told ESPN, "I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back, and now my mom had to leave again." On January 2, 2002, JoLinda mother went back to prison to serve his mother 14-month sentence.his mother says his mother has been clean since 2003.Wade chose to play college basketball for Tom Crean at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.During Wade's freshman year at Marquette, Wade was ineligible to play with the men's team as Wade had fallen short of academic standards set by the NCAA's Proposition 48.Wade sought tutoring to improve Wade writing skills in order to regain eligibility.Wade was a member of the 2004 U.S.national team with fellow NBA All-Stars LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony.national team with fellow NBA All-Stars LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.The team won a bronze medal, which disappointed many United States' fans who had hoped for a return to the days of the original "Dream Team".Wade was named to the national team from 2006 to 2008.Wade was named co-captain of the 2006 team, along with James and Anthony.In 2007, due to injury, Wade was unable to compete at the FIBA Americas Championship, where the United States compiled a 10–0 record and qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went unbeaten and earned gold medal honors, defeating the 2006 World champion Spain in the final game.Wade led the team in scoring throughout the tournament and tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in the game.For the tournament, Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists and 2.3 steals, as the United States lived up to the United States Redeem Team moniker and captured gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.On June 28, 2012, it was reported that Wade would miss the 2012 Summer Olympics in London because of knee surgery.Standing at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade is a shooting guard that is also capable of playing point guard as Wade did during Wade rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups.On offense, Wade has established Wade as one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in the NBA.Wade's signature one-two step allows he to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot.Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently; Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season.Wade has proven Wade an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout Wade career.After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA.Wade has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.David Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players in the off-season, also cites Wade's developing post up game as one of He strengths."Watching Wade operate on the left block is literally like watching old footage of MJ (Michael Jordan)", comments Thorpe.Thorpe goes on to say that Wade's best moves from the post are Thorpe turnaround jump shot, double pivot, and what Thorpe terms as a "freeze fake", a pump fake Wade uses to get Thorpe opponent to jump, so that Thorpe can then drive around Thorpe to the basket.The main weakness cited in Wade's ability is fake Wade lack of three-point range; fake Wade has averaged .289 on three-point field goal attempts for fake Wade career.Wade is best known for fake Wade ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.As crowd pleasing as Wade high-flying style of basketball may be, some have expressed concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner, as Wade has already hurt Wade knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players.Wade has also established Wade on defense for Wade ability to block shots and accumulate steals.Wade became the NBA's all-time leader in blocks for players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which Wade achieved in only 679 games, over 400 games less than the previous record holder: Dennis Johnson (1,100).Wade married Wade high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002.Wade filed for a divorce in 2007, which was granted in 2010 after a lengthy and acrimonious court battle.In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of Wade two sons with Funches.Wade also raises a nephew, who is the son of Wade's sister Deanna.Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2009.According to Wade, Wade and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.During that time, Wade and longtime friend Aja Metoyer conceived a son.Wade and longtime friend Aja Metoyer became engaged in December 2013, and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when a father Union welcomed the birth of Wade and Union daughter who was born via surrogate.Wade has spoken out about violence in Chicago, in part due to Wade own family's experience with it.Wade nephew, Darin Johnson, was shot twice in the leg in 2012 but recovered.Wade's first cousin, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge, was fatally shot on the afternoon of August 26, 2016, while pushing a stroller in Chicago's Parkway Gardens, when two men exchanged gunfire nearby, hitting her in the arm and the head.A mother of four, Aldridge was pronounced dead at the hospital.The child in the stroller was not hurt.Wade, who had recently spoken publicly the area's problem of violence, reacted by tweeting, "Another act of senseless gun violence.4 kids lost 4 kids mom for NO REASON.Unreal.#EnoughIsEnough".Wade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, "him's the greatest in the Universe", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon.The Heat's 2005 NBA Playoffs run and Wade's performances with Shaquille O'Neal hampered by injury, led to an explosion of media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity.During NBA Playoffs, Wade's jersey became the top selling jersey in the league and remained so for nearly two years.After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade was further elevated into the public's eye and appeared on several talk shows, including Late Show with David Letterman and Live with Regis and Kelly.David Letterman also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's Austin & Ally as David Letterman, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.Wade has been featured in a number of magazine articles and publications.In 2005, Wade was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 2006 Wade was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ Magazine.In 2007, Esquire named he to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.Wade has endorsement deals with companies such as Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (Wade TV commercials feature Wade paired with NBA legend Charles Barkley), and Topps.Wade had Wade own line of shoes with Converse named "The Wade" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse named "The Wade" to Nike's Jordan Brand.Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms, stating, "When I came into the NBA, I didn't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave me an opportunity to head a brand and be the face of a brand.I'm really thankful for six long, good years.I've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand because five shoes put my name on a pair of sneakers." Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break.During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand,

a two-bedroom, one-story house in the northeast part of town.In He childhood, He received the nickname "Duke" from He father, because, according to He, He always "wanted to be top dog." He suffered a traumatic eye injury at age five, when, while playing with an improvised hobby horse He constructed with two sticks nailed together; He tripped and accidentally poked He left eye with a rusty nail.The family could not afford emergency surgery, leaving his left eye to heal on his left eye own and diminishing Bing vision thereafter.Bing's father also suffered a severe head injury during the boy's childhood.While working a construction site, a brick fell four stories onto  Bing's father head, causing a brain clot.The episode led young Bing to promise his that his would never work in such a profession.In athletics, young Bing played basketball, but older children often told his his was too small for the game.However, young Bing played well, triumphing over such older and bigger children as future Motown musician Marvin Gaye, who, after not performing well on the court, chose to sing on the sidelines.Bing and Gaye forged a friendship, which continued later in life.Despite Bing and Gaye basketball play, Bing, a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers and Jackie Robinson, focused primarily on baseball, the neighborhood's preferred game.Despite Bing and Gaye fuzzy vision, Bing and Gaye excelled in baseball at Spingarn High School, where Bing and Gaye enrolled in 1958.Nevertheless, the school's head basketball coach William Roundtree encouraged the school's head basketball coach William Roundtree to revisit basketball.William Roundtree became a fatherly figure to Bing, who decided to join the team.Roundtree developed into a double-digits per game scorer, noted for Roundtree jump shot and knack for driving to the basket.He continued also to compete in baseball into He senior year, but was forced to choose between his senior year and basketball when a scheduling conflict between two tournaments arose.Though He felt He was better at baseball, He opted for basketball, believing it gave He a greater chance at a full-ride college scholarship, well aware of the path taken by Los Angeles Lakers forward Elgin Baylor, a Spingarn alum.At the tournament, he led he team to victory and earned MVP honors.All in all, in high school, Bing was a three-year letter winner, all–Inter High, all-Metro, and all-East member.In 1962, he was featured in Parade magazine and made the All-American Team.Bing attended Syracuse University, where he was once roommates with Jim Boeheim.Bing led the Orangemen in scoring as a sophomore (22.2) in 1964, as a junior (23.2) in 1965, and as a senior (28.4) in 1966.During He senior year, He was fifth in the nation in scoring and was Syracuse's first consensus All-American in 39 years.Bing was also named to The Sporting News All-America First Team and was named Syracuse Athlete of the Year.In He three year varsity career at Syracuse, Bing averaged 24.8 points and 10.3 rebounds, with 1883 total points and 786 total rebounds in 76 games.Bing's playing style was somewhat unusual for the time. As a lean, athletic and explosive guard, he functioned as the playmaker distributing the ball, but also did more shooting and scoring than most others who had this position.At one time a joke about he and he backcourt partner, Jimmy Walker, was that it was a shame him and his backcourt partner, Jimmy Walker could only play the game with one ball at a time.Bing was awarded the J.Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1977.Bing was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990.In 2006, Bing was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of FameFame.In 1996, Bing was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players.At age 22 with an the NBA contract worth $15,000, Bing was rebuffed by the National Bank of Detroit on getting a mortgage to finance a home.This led Bing to work at the National Bank of Detroit during the offseason, holding jobs in the teller, customer relations, and mortgage departments.Immediately after retiring, Bing worked at a warehouse of the steel processing company Paragon Steel and was paid $35,000.he left after two years, after stints in the steel processing company Paragon Steel's shipping and sales operations.On January 19, 2009, Bing was to be named as a recipient of the National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award.the National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award honors athletes who have made significant contributions to civil and human rights and who helped establish a foundation for future leaders in athletic careers in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. The honor was to be presented during the half-time show of the game between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Detroit Pistons in Memphis, Tennessee.Bing volunteered in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program.Kermit Washington's mother Barbara graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into Howard University), where Kermit Washington's mother Barbara was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an X-ray technician.Kermit Washington's had a rough childhood.When he was three years old, he parents had a fight in which he maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked he uncle with an iron.his parents soon divorced, with he father awarded custody of the children.His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took His and His older brother Eric from him and his older brother Eric father on an ill-advised sojourn for which him and his older brother Eric were poorly prepared.Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called the children father, who came and took the children back.His stay with His father did not last long, and His and His brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.The effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth.The only time His recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when His great-grandmother on His father's side had the pair for a while.According to Washington, his great-grandmother on his father's side loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive.After his father remarried, the children moved back in with his and his new wife.Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying "I thought it was our dream come true.All our lives our had seen nice families on TV.Real ones.Now we were going to be a real family." However, he again felt unwanted this time by he stepmother.As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to he younger brother, Chris.Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of he childhood.his had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades.When He entered high school He played football merely so He could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as He was terrified of walking home alone.As a senior in high school, Washington stood 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) but weighed a mere 150 lbs.After some rare positive feedback by he biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class.some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects.When Thomas became Thomas home room teacher and saw He grades in other classes Thomas encouraged He to try hard in all of He courses.Washington rapidly improved Thomas marks, making the honor roll in Thomas senior year.Thomas basketball performance in high school was unimpressive.his came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg).He stepmother informed He that when He graduated from high school He would be thrown out of the house.Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go.Chris trained for three hours a day toward the end of Chris senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington himself and Pennsylvania, where Chris talked Chris way into the game.Tom Young, who had recently left He job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at American University, saw He play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, He was impressed by He hustle and how He ignored the poor treatment He received from the people who organized the game.During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches.his began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance.Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that He later said He life could be separated into two parts—He pre-college life and He life after college.he has frequently described he college years as "the happiest time in my life." he began dating he future wife Pat when he was a freshman.They met after she noticed He accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game.she pursued him even though him often remained silent when she spent time with him.A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome him low self-esteem.Washington spent a lot of him free time practicing in the gym.his played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams.He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on He freshman team at American.Pat helped He with He grades—despite the fact that He had done well He senior year of high school He was still far behind; He did not even know what a paragraph was when He entered college or how to write a report.He averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in He first year of varsity basketball.him still played a somewhat unaggressive or "soft" brand of basketball, and it was hurting him chances of being drafted by a professional team.Between He sophomore and junior years He began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the University of Nebraska who was studying as an undergrad at American.his encouraged his to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told his that it was not in his nature.Coleman admonished Coleman, telling Coleman Coleman could not afford to be "cool" on the court given Coleman talent level if Coleman wanted to join the pro ranks.Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year.his averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an NCAA-leading 19.8 rebounds in his junior season.He was drafted after He junior season by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished He.He decided to stay at American with coach Young for He senior season because He felt He owed the school which had given He a chance when He was coming out of a difficult period in high school.He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 Olympic basketball team after the season, but did not make the squad.Washington was one of the best players in Washington going into his senior season.He marveled at newspaper reports in the Washington Post that mentioned "coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop Washington." He led Washington in rebounding again in his senior season.He was a second team All-American, and helped American into the National Invitation Tournament (NIT).In the last game of He college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for He career in college.his became extremely nervous before the last game of his college career and could neither eat nor sleep.the game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on He feet when He was introduced before the raucous crowd.his managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark.He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game.He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology.Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences He senior year.Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft.A week before the Los Angeles Lakers began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married.Pat and Kermit invited neither of Pat and Kermit families; Pat and Kermit just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony.He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward.Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in NBA.He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in He becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo.Washington admits that He was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time He made a mistake in front of He.Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game he rookie season.healthy hurt healthy back that year but kept quiet about that year, fearing healthy would be "labeled soft." The injury would bother healthy the rest of healthy career.He continued to struggle in He second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult.Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when the coaches assuming players entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with He on a one-on-one basis.It was very hard for head coach Bill Sharman to show affection.Sometimes I would ask him directly if him really cared about me, and him would say something like, "I think you're really nice." It was hard for him to be more open than that.him had never really been nurtured, never really been loved.I came to believe if I nurtured He enough, if I loved He enough, He would get past all that.But I don't believe him ever really did.Washington currently lives in the Washington, D.C.area, where he is employed as a regional representative of the National Basketball Players Association.Barry grew up in Roselle Park, New Jersey, graduating from Roselle Park High School in 1962.Barry was an All-American basketball player for the University of Miami, where Barry starred for three seasons.While at Miami, Barry met Barry wife Pamela, the daughter of Hurricanes head coach Bruce Hale.As a senior in the 1964–65 campaign, Barry led the NCAA with a 37.4 points-per-game average.Barry and the Hurricanes did not take part in the NCAA Tournament, however, because the basketball program was on probation at the time.Barry is one of just two basketball players to have Barry number retired by the school.Barry was drafted by the San Francisco Warriors with the second pick of the 1965 NBA draft.During the 1990s, Barry coached the Cedar Rapids Sharpshooters of the Global Basketball Association and the Continental Basketball Association, guiding the Fort Wayne Fury to a 19-37 win-loss record in 1993–94.In 1998 and 1999, he served as head coach of the New Jersey ShoreCats of the United States Basketball League.Former Warriors teammate Clifford Ray was Former Warriors top assistant.Former Warriors finished 2nd in Former Warriors division at the 2005 World Long Drive Championship.Former Warriors is part owner and promoter for the Ektio basketball shoe, which doctor and former college basketball player Barry Katz designed to reduce ankle injuries.Barry also serves on the company's Board of Directors.Barry was among the first professional basketball players to make a successful transition to the broadcasting profession.Barry began broadcasting during the 1967–68 season broadcasting Oakland Oaks games because of contractual matters that kept Barry off of the court.Barry continues to work in the field, a career that began with Barry own radio show in San Francisco and CBS while still an active player and then with TBS.While working as a CBS analyst during Game 5 of the 1981 NBA Finals, Barry made a controversial comment when CBS displayed an old photo of colleague Bill Russell, who is African-American, and Barry joked that "it looks like some fool over there with that big watermelon grin".Barry later apologized for a controversial comment, claiming that Barry did not realize that a reference to watermelons would have racial overtones.Russell said that Russell believed Barry with regard to Barry's racial attitudes, but nonetheless, the two men are reported not to have been particularly friendly for other reasons, unrelated to the comment.CBS did not renew Barry's employment for the subsequent season, with producers later citing the overall negative tone of Barry's game commentary.The next season, Barry did some broadcasting for the Seattle SuperSonics, however a plan for permanent employment fell through when Barry insisted that Barry then-wife be allowed to join Barry when the team was on the road, which would have been contrary to team policy.The next year, Barry was featured in a lengthy Sports Illustrated article written by Tony Kornheiser in which Barry lamented the failure of Barry broadcasting career to that point, as well as the fact that Barry'd left a reputation within NBA circles for being an unlikable person.After this, Barry worked with TBS and later on, TNT into the 1989–90 season, mostly as a color analyst but sometimes as a play-by-play announcer paired with Bill Russell.One of the more notable games Barry called as play-by-play announcer on TBS was Game 5 of the 1985 Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers, where Larry Bird made a last second steal that sealed the win and the Eastern Conference Championship for the Boston Celtics.After the 1989–90 season, Barry became the color analyst for the Atlanta Hawks' games that aired on TBS, paired with Skip Caray.In a rare non-sports venture, Barry hosted the pilot for the mid-1980s game show Catchphrase;

Premier League Player of the Month

The Premier League Player of the Month is an association football award that recognises the best adjudged Premier League player each month of the season. The winner is chosen by a combination of an online public vote, which contributes to 10% of the final tally, a panel of experts, and the captain of each Premier League club. It has been called the Carling Premiership Player of the Month (1994–2001), the Barclaycard Premiership Player of the Month (2001–2004) and the Barclays Player of the Month (2004–2016); it is currently known as the EA Sports Player of the Month.

The Premier League was formed in 1992, when the members of the First Division resigned from the Football League. These clubs set up a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The Premier League introduced new Manager of the Month and Manager of the Season awards for the 1993–94 season, supplementing the existing Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year awards. For the 1994–95 season, the Premier League introduced the Player of the Month award, which is presented alongside the Manager of the Month award. The first Player of the Month was awarded to Tottenham Hotspur player Jürgen Klinsmann for his performances in August 1994.

Steven Gerrard and Harry Kane have been Player of the Month the most with six awards. Six players have won the award in consecutive months: Robbie Fowler, Dennis Bergkamp, Cristiano Ronaldo, Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Mohamed Salah. Only Mohamed Salah has won the award three times in a season, and 16 individuals have won two awards in a season: Robbie Fowler, Dennis Bergkamp, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Thierry Henry, Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ashley Young, Peter Odemwingie, Robin van Persie, Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suárez, Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Sergio Agüero and Son Heung-min. Robbie Keane has won the award while playing for three clubs, while 12 players have won the award playing for two clubs: Alan Shearer, Dion Dublin, David Ginola, Dwight Yorke, Tim Flowers, Teddy Sheringham, Danny Murphy, Andrew Johnson, Nicolas Anelka, Dimitar Berbatov, Scott Parker, Robin van Persie.

The award has been shared on six occasions: by Blackburn Rovers's Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton in November 1994, Liverpool's Robbie Fowler and Stan Collymore in January 1996, Southampton's Kevin Davies and Manchester United's Andy Cole in November 1997, Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp and Edu in February 2004, Tottenham Hotspur's Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane in April 2007 and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Luis Suárez in April 2014. Almost half of the Player of the Month awards have gone to English players, and a quarter of foreign winners have been French or Dutch. Manchester United have had more Player of the Month awards than any other club.

As of January 2019, the most recent recipient of the award is Manchester United player Marcus Rashford.

Premier League Player of the Season

The Premier League Player of the Season is an annual association football award presented to players in England, which recognises the most outstanding player in the Premier League each season. The recipient is chosen by a panel assembled by the league's sponsors consisting of members of "football's governing bodies, the media and fans", and is announced in the second or third week of May. For sponsorship purposes, from 1994 to 2001 it was called the Carling Player of the Year, from 2001 to 2004 as the Barclaycard Player of the Year;, and from 2004 to 2016 as the Barclays Player of the Season. Since the 2016–17 season, it is called the EA Sports Player of the Season.

The Premier League was founded in 1992, when the clubs of the First Division left the Football League and established a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The newly formed league had no sponsor for its inaugural season until Carling agreed to a four-year £12 million deal that started the following season. That same season, Carling introduced individual awards for players, such as the Golden Boot. However, the Player of the Month and Player of the Season awards were only first bestowed during the 1994–95 season. The first Player of the Season award was given to Blackburn Rovers striker Alan Shearer, who won the Premier League title with his team and the Golden Boot that season.

Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nemanja Vidić have been Player of the Season on two occasions each and are the only players to have won the award more than once, with Ronaldo having achieved this in consecutive years (2007 and 2008). Eight players were the Premier League's leading goalscorer and won the Golden Boot alongside the Player of the Season award. Four of these players – Kevin Phillips, Henry, Ronaldo and Luis Suárez – went on to win the European Golden Shoe in the same season. 11 players have won the Premier League trophy with their respective clubs in the same year they received the award, with Ronaldo and Vidić each accomplishing the feat on two occasions with Manchester United. Ronaldo is the only player to be named Player of the Season and win the FIFA World Player of the Year; when he accomplished this in 2008, he became the first player from the Premier League to voted the world's top footballer.

List of Premier League goalkeepers with 100 or more clean sheets

In association football a goalkeeper may be said to "keep a clean sheet" if they prevent their opponents scoring any goals during an entire match.

Since the Premier League's formation at the start of the 1992–93 season, 15 goalkeepers have managed to keep 100 or more clean sheets in the Premier League.

During the 1997–98 season, Peter Schmeichel became the first player to keep 100 Premier League clean sheets. 

Petr Čech holds the record for most clean sheets kept in a single season, with 24. The record for consecutive clean sheets was also set by Čech, who became the first goalkeeper to keep ten consecutive clean sheets; Edwin van der Sar later eclipsed this when he went 14 games without conceding in 2008–09 for Manchester United.

The first goalkeepers to keep a clean sheet in the Premier League were Tim Flowers and Erik Thorstvedt on the opening day of the inaugural season in a 0–0 draw between Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur; all other goalkeepers conceded that day.

Each year the goalkeeper who has kept the most clean sheets during the Premier League campaign is awarded the Premier League Golden Glove award. First presented in 2004–05, six goalkeepers have won the award, with Joe Hart and Petr Čech holding the joint record for most wins at four.

List of Premier League hat-tricks

Since the inception of the English football league competition, the Premier League, in 1992, more than 100 players have scored three goals (a hat-trick) or more in a single match. The first player to achieve the feat was Frenchman Eric Cantona, who scored three times for Leeds United in a 5–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Twenty players have scored more than three goals in a match; of these, five players, Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Jermain Defoe, Dimitar Berbatov and Sergio Agüero have scored five. Sadio Mané holds the record for the quickest Premier League hat-trick, netting three times for Southampton against Aston Villa in 2 minutes 56 seconds, breaking Robbie Fowler's record, while in 1999, Manchester United player Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored four goals in twelve minutes as a substitute against Nottingham Forest, "the fastest scorer of a four-goal haul on record in England".

The fixture between Arsenal and Southampton at Highbury in 2003 saw both Jermaine Pennant and Robert Pires score a hat-trick for the home team. In 2007, Blackburn's Roque Santa Cruz and Wigan's Marcus Bent both scored hat-tricks in a match that Wigan won 5–3. Only five players – Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Didier Drogba, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane – have scored hat-tricks in two consecutive league games. Rooney's hat-trick on 10 September 2011 and Matt Le Tissier's hat-trick on 19 August 1995 were scored through set pieces, which consists of penalty kicks and direct free kicks. Everton's Duncan Ferguson and Salomón Rondón of West Bromwich Albion are the only Premier League players to have scored a hat-trick of headers.

Shearer and Sergio Agüero have scored three or more goals eleven times in the Premier League, more than any other player. Robbie Fowler has scored nine; Thierry Henry and Michael Owen have scored eight hat-tricks each. Five players have each scored hat-tricks for three different clubs: Yakubu (Blackburn Rovers, Everton and Portsmouth); Nicolas Anelka (Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City); Kevin Campbell (Arsenal, Everton and Nottingham Forest); Les Ferdinand (Newcastle United, Queens Park Rangers and Tottenham Hotspur) and Teddy Sheringham (Manchester United, Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur).

Four players have scored hat-tricks and still ended up on the losing side: Matt Le Tissier (twice), Dion Dublin, Roque Santa Cruz and Dwight Yorke.

The Dubious Goals Committee has sometimes decided after a match that players have not scored hat-tricks because one of the goals was incorrectly credited to them. Southampton player Egil Østenstad was thought to have scored a hat-trick against Manchester United in 1996, but the committee ruled that one of the goals be credited as an own goal to United's Phil Neville. Anelka's first goal for Manchester City in September 2002 was later credited as an own goal to Everton's Tomasz Radzinski. Javier Hernández was denied a hat-trick against Aston Villa in November 2011 after the committee ruled his second goal was actually an own goal by Ron Vlaar.

The following table lists the minimum number of hat-tricks scored by players who have scored two or more hat-tricks.

List of Premier League players with 500 or more appearances

Since the Premier League's formation at the start of the 1992–93 season, 13 players have accrued 500 or more appearances in the Premier League.

The first player to reach the milestone was midfielder Gary Speed, in representation of Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers; his 500th match was Bolton's 4–0 win over West Ham United on 9 December 2006. Speed held the record for most appearances until 14 February 2009, when goalkeeper David James played his 536th match, for Portsmouth against his former team Manchester City. James ended with 572 appearances, a record which was broken by Ryan Giggs on 14 May 2011, having played all of his matches for Manchester United. On 25 September 2017, Gareth Barry broke Giggs' record by playing his 633rd match, West Bromwich Albion's 2–0 loss at Arsenal. At the time of breaking the record, Barry ranked 8th in English top division appearances since the Second World War, trailing Giggs in 6th (672 total top division appearances) and six other players.

Ryan Giggs (Manchester United), Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher (both Liverpool) are the only three players to have achieved the accolade of 500+ Premier League appearances exclusively for one club. James Milner, Emile Heskey and David James each played for five different clubs (the most clubs for this achievement) on their way to 500+ Premier League games. The only player from outside the United Kingdom to play 500 Premier League games is Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, for Middlesbrough, Fulham, Chelsea and Leicester City.

Premier League Golden Glove

The Premier League Golden Glove is an annual association football award presented to the goalkeeper who has kept the most clean sheets (when a goalkeeper concedes no goals during a single match) in the Premier League. For sponsorship purposes, it has been referred to as the Barclays Golden Glove since its inception during the 2004–05 season until the 2015–16 season. Since 2017–18 season, it is known as the Cadbury Golden Glove. Originally, the Golden Glove could only be won outright by a single player; should there have been a tie, the goalkeeper with the superior clean sheets-to-games ratio received the award. However, starting in the 2013–14 season, the Golden Glove is shared by goalkeepers with an equal number of clean sheets, regardless of the number of games they played.

The Premier League was founded in 1992, when the clubs of the First Division left the Football League and established a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. In 2005, the Premier League Golden Glove was first awarded, with Petr Čech its inaugural recipient. Čech and Joe Hart have won the award on four occasions, the most out of all goalkeepers. Hart played for Manchester City in each of his four winning seasons and they are the club that has received the award the most. Čech and Hart's four awards mean Czech and English goalkeepers have won the Golden Glove the most, ahead of Spain with three. Both Pepe Reina and Hart have won the award in three consecutive seasons, which is a record.

Čech set the record for matches without conceding a goal in a single season – with 24 – to win the inaugural award in 2005. During the 2008–09 season, Edwin van der Sar surpassed Čech's previous record of 10 consecutive clean sheets by reaching 14. During his streak, Van der Sar went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal. In the process, he broke Čech's Premier League record (1,025 minutes), Steve Death's Football League record (1,103 minutes) and the all-time league record in Britain (1,155 minutes) for most consecutive scoreless minutes. Manchester United keeper David de Gea is the winner for the 2017–18 season.

<doc id="27309200" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27309200" title="Premier League Golden Boot">
Premier League Golden Boot

The Premier League Golden Boot is an annual association football award presented to the leading goalscorer in the Premier League. For sponsorship purposes, it was called the Carling Golden Boot from 1994 to 2001, from 2001 to 2004 as the Barclaycard Golden Boot, and the Barclays Golden Boot (2005–2016). Since 2017, it is known as the Cadbury Golden Boot. In addition to the trophy, winners of the Golden Boot are usually given £1,000 for every goal they scored throughout the season to donate to a charity of their choice, although Robin van Persie was given £30,000 after scoring 26 goals in the 2012–13 season.

The Premier League was founded in 1992, when the clubs of the First Division left the Football League and established a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The newly formed league had no sponsor for its inaugural season until Carling agreed to a four-year £12 million deal that started the following season, and it was simply known as the Premier League in its first year. As a result, the award was called the "Premier League Golden Boot" when Teddy Sheringham received the inaugural award in 1993. Originally consisting of 22 teams, the league contracted to 20 teams after the 1994–95 season; this reduced the number of games played from 42 to 38.

Thierry Henry has won the Golden Boot on four occasions, more than any other player. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Dwight Yorke were the first non-English and non-European winners, respectively, when they shared the award with Michael Owen in 1999. Alan Shearer is the only player other than Henry to win the award in three consecutive seasons. Phillips, Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez won the European Golden Shoe in the same season as the Premier League Golden Boot, with Henry achieving this on two occasions (2004 and 2005). Shearer, Hasselbaink and Van Persie are the only players to win the Golden Boot with two clubs.

Andy Cole and Shearer – with 34 goals in 1993–94 and 1994–95, respectively – scored the most goals to win the Golden Boot when the Premier League was a 42-game season, Mohamed Salah with 32 goals in 2017–18 holds the record for the current 38-game season, while Nicolas Anelka scored the fewest to clinch the award outright, with 19 goals in 2008–09. The all-time record for lowest number of goals scored to be bestowed the award, however, is 18 goals; this was achieved during the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons, when the award was shared between three players both times. The latter season marked the last time the Golden Boot was shared until 2010–11, when Dimitar Berbatov and Carlos Tevez both scored 20 goals that season to tie for the award. Harry Kane recorded the highest goals-to-games ratio to win the award, scoring 29 goals in 30 games in 2016–17 for a rate of 0.97.

More specifically,

Clubs listed are those for which the player has played at least one Premier League game — and seasons are those in which the player has played at least one Premier League game. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, "1992–95" indicates that the player has played in every season from 1992–93 to 1994–95, but not necessarily every calendar year from 1992 to 1995. Therefore, a player should always have a listing under at least two years — for instance, a player making his debut in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, will have '2011–12' after his name. This follows general practice in expressing sporting seasons in the UK.

109 of the 207 foreign FIFA-affiliated nations have been represented in the Premier League. On 9 September 2018, the Central African Republic became the most recent nation to be represented after Frédéric Nimani switched his international allegiance and made his debut for the African nation.

The Premier League is an association football league that serves as the top tier of the English football league system. The league was founded in 1992 when the clubs of the First Division decided to break away from the Football League, as a commercially independent entity that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements.

Since the 2012–13 season, a player needs to have played in a minimum of five matches for a title-winning team to qualify for a medal. This is down from the previous standard of ten matches played. At the discretion of the Premier League board, additional medals can be awarded to players who played less than five matches. This special dispensation is usually reserved for back-up goalkeepers and players who did not make the minimum number of appearances through injury. For the first season, players received a miniature version of the trophy rather than a medal.

As of the end of the 2017–18 season, six clubs have won the title – Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Leicester City – with 508 medals awarded to 262 players. Having won 13 Premier League championships, Manchester United have more title-winning players to their name than any other club, with 86 players awarded 247 medals. Ryan Giggs, who spent his entire career at the club, has won more medals than any other player with 13. Over a third of medals have been awarded to English players and the next most frequent nationalities of winners are French and Brazilian.

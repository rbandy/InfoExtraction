Dr.In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years.Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing Buss to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing Buss how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.Johnson credits Buss with giving Buss the business knowledge that enabled Buss to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.Buss supported Johnson as Buss revealed Buss diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and Buss never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing Johnson in as part-owner, and even as a coach.Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but Johnson agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request.In 1992, Buss' had given Johnson a contract that paid Johnson $14 million a year, as payback for all the years Johnson was not the league's highest paid player.Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided a contract that paid him $14 million a year, Buss insisted that Buss still be paid.It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary.After Johnson ended Johnson coaching stint, Johnson sold Johnson a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.Johnson was selected third overall in the 1977 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were coached by Don Nelson.Johnson helped lead Milwaukee to several division titles (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984).In Johnson second season in 1978–79, Johnson was the NBA's third leading scorer (25.6 PPG), behind George Gervin (29.6) and Lloyd Free (28.8).his claims to have coined the term point forward, a position his played out of necessity in 1984.During the 1984 playoffs, Milwaukee became short on point guards due to injuries.Nelson instructed Johnson to set up the offense from Nelson forward position.Johnson responded, "OK, so instead of a point guard, I'm a point forward".Johnson and the Bucks reached as far as the Eastern Conference Finals twice, in 1983 and again in 1984.In the 1984 off-season, Nelson — who was also Bucks general manager — traded Johnson, forward-guard Junior Bridgeman, forward Harvey Catchings and cash to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for forward Terry Cummings, and guards Craig Hodges and Ricky Pierce.This was a homecoming for Johnson, as Johnson grew up and attended high school just a few miles from the Los Angeles Clippers home at Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.the Clippers' the Clippers' struggled to win.Johnson later said that playing for those losing The Clippers teams "kind of wore you down and made you feel like you were kind of the JV team in Los Angeles." Being named the team captain by head coach Don Chaney, a fellow Louisianan, was one of the few things that kept Johnson from demanding a trade.During a game in the 1986–87 season, Johnson suffered a neck injury, which effectively ended Johnson career.Johnson made a brief comeback during the 1989–90 season, playing only 10 games with the Warriors before retiring on December 27, 1989.The Bucks plan to retire Johnson's No.8 jersey on March 24, 2019.As Johnson playing career ended, Johnson got into the entertainment business, as Johnson acted in small roles in many films, including White Men Can't Jump, Love and Action in Chicago, Blue Chips, and Forget Paris.For a while, Johnson served a color analyst for the Seattle SuperSonics in the late 1990s and is regularly seen nationally on Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports 1 as a basketball analyst.Since 2015 Johnson has also worked as a part-time analyst for Milwaukee Bucks telecasts on Fox Sports Wisconsin.Johnson is still actively enhancing Johnson creative roots, writing screenplays and short stories.Johnson was formerly the early morning show co-host on the Clippers' flagship radio station, KFWB-AM in Los Angeles.Johnson has five sons, Kris, Josiah, Joshua, Moriah and Cyrus.Kris, like Kris , played basketball at Crenshaw High and UCLA.Johnson and Kris are the first father–son combo to be honored as Los Angeles City Section 4-A Player of the Year.Johnson and Kris are also one of four father-son duos to each win an NCAA basketball championship and the only ones to accomplish it at the same school.Josiah also played basketball at UCLA, but later helped create the Comedy Central show, The Legends of Chamberlain Heights.Moriah is a star on the BET's Baldwin Hills.Johnson also has two daughters.Jasmine is an accomplished tennis player, while Shiloh excels at golf and swimming.Johnson played collegiately at Oregon State University under Naismith Hall of Fame coach Ralph Miller.Johnson was the star player on the 1980–81 team (known as the Orange Express) which reached as high as #1 in the national rankings, before losing in the NCAA basketball playoffs.

the team intended to start Johnson at power forward alongside defensive-minded center Sam Bowie.Five games into the season, however, Sam Bowie suffered a broken leg (one of many such injuries Sam Bowie would endure in Sam Bowie ill-fated career), and Johnson was moved to the starting center role, with aging veteran Caldwell Jones replacing Johnson at power forward.That year, Johnson enjoyed Johnson best season as a pro, averaging nearly 17 points a game, and shooting a respectable 0.555 from the field.The next season, Bowie again broke Bowie leg, and Johnson assumed the starting center position.Unfortunately for Bowie, Bowie would Bowie be injured, and was replaced in the lineup by Kevin Duckworth, whose stellar play earned Bowie the job permanently.Nevertheless, him earned a selection on the West All-Star team, but was unable to play due to injury.An attempt to start both players in a dual-post configuration, and the Johnson/Duckworth controversy was one of several which distracted the West All-Star team in the 1988–89 season (which led to a losing record and a first-round playoff sweep).After the 1988–89 season, the rather unhappy Johnson was left unprotected in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, and was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves.Johnson, unhappy with being drafted by an expansion team, played only 4 games for the Minnesota Timberwolves before being traded to the Seattle SuperSonics; Johnson played only 21 games for the Sonics that season.Johnson played 24 games for the Golden State Warriors the following year; and retired at the conclusion of the 1990–1991 season.Johnson holds the NCAA single season and career records for field goal percentage.Johnson led the NBA in personal fouls during the 1981–82 and 1986–87 seasons, and led the NBA in disqualifications during the 1981–82, 1985–86, and 1986–87 seasons.Johnson, who retired from playing to permanently settle in Portland source, now works with an organization called The Best of Yachting and is an investor in business in the area.Johnston was a 1946 graduate of Chillicothe High School in Chillicothe, Ohio, where Johnston was an all-state selection in basketball.Johnston attended Ohio State University, where Johnston starred in baseball and basketball.Johnston signed a professional baseball contract with the Philadelphia Phillies out of college and pitched two-and-a-half years for the Philadelphia Phillies.With a 3–9 record halfway through Johnston third losing season in 1951, Johnston decided to give pro basketball a try.With the assistance of Johnston manager, Jim Ward, Johnston tried out for the Philadelphia Warriors at the team camp in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Johnston led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons: 1952–53, 1953–54, and 1954–55.During the 1954–55 season, Johnston also won the league's rebounding title.he led the league in minutes played in the 1952–53 season, 1953–54 season and in field goal percentage in the 1952–53 and  1955–56 season and 1956–57 season.He led the NBA in Win Shares for five consecutive seasons.He played He entire career with the Philadelphia Warriors, playing on the Philadelphia Warriors championship team in 1956.Johnston played in six NBA All-Star Games, was an All-NBA First Team selection four times, and was an All-NBA Second Team selection once.During He career, the 6-foot, 8-inch Johnston was well known for He sweeping right-handed hook shot.Johnston was forced to retire after a serious knee injury in the 1958–59 season.During Johnston eight-year career, Johnston averaged 19.4 points per game, 11.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists, with a field goal percentage of .444 and a free throw percentage of .768.After his playing career, his coached the Warriors to a 95–59 record for the first two seasons of Wilt Chamberlain's NBA career.his also worked as an assistant coach at Wake Forest University under Jack McCloskey.In addition, Johnston coached the Pittsburgh Rens and Connie Hawkins of the American Basketball League.Johnston also coached the Wilmington Blue Bombers of the American Basketball League.In 1972, He was an assistant coach with the Portland Trail Blazers.he last job was as athletic director at North Lake College in Irving, Texas.On September 28, 1978, Johnston died of a heart attack at age 49 while playing basketball in Bedford, Texas.In 1980, Johnston was inducted posthumously into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.In 1990, Johnston was enshrined posthumously into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame and the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of FameFame.In 2005, Johnston was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of FameFame.In 2016, a Chillicothe resident, Bruce Caplinger, began raising money to erect a statue of Johnston outside of Chillicothe High School.Jokić was a member of the Serbian U-19 national basketball team that won the silver medal at the 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship.Over eight tournament games, Jokić averaged 7.1 points, 5 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game.he represented Serbia at the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade, where he averaged 17.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game while earning tournament MVP honors.At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Serbia won the silver medal, after losing to the United States in the final game 96–66.Jokić has two older brothers, Nemanja and Strahinja.The younger of the two, Nemanja, played college basketball at the University of Detroit Mercy.Both of them are friends with former NBA player Darko Miličić.Bobby Jones was one of the most admired defenders ever to wear an NBA uniform; Bobby Jones was also considered one of the most virtuous.While most other players depended on the occasional thrown elbow, hip-check, or grab of the uniform to gain an advantage, Bobby Jones relied on hustle and determination.It was Jones’ stellar defense along with Jones other specialties such as leadership, that made Jones a standout sixth man.Opposing teams could ill afford to relax on defense when Jones came off the bench, and Opposing teams also had to work a lot harder on offense to get the ball in or even near the basket.Jones's coaches used to marvel that Jones was so good at the things Jones's coaches had trouble getting many other players to do at all, such as block shots, move without the ball, hustle back on defense, tip passes, dive after loose balls, give up an open outside shot so a teammate could hit from inside—all the things that rarely, if ever, show up in a box score.Jones was as unselfish as a player could be, so much so that coaches had to implore Jones to take more shots.What that work added up to was a 12-year pro career that featured eight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team; the first-ever NBA Sixth Man Award; membership on the ABA All-Rookie Team; four appearances in the NBA All-Star Game and one in the ABA All-Star Game; and perhaps most prized, an NBA Championship with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983.Above all, Jones's value as a player was evidenced by the fact that Jones teams never missed the playoffs.As for vices such as drinking, smoking, and cursing, his teams were out of the question.When a computer-generated ranking sponsored by Seagram Distillers rated Jones the NBA's "most consistent and productive player" in 1976–77, Jones the NBA's turned over the $10,000 prize to religious charities.At the award dinner (held without alcohol at Jones the NBA's's request) Jones the NBA's pronounced from the podium: "I’m definitely against whiskey, and I just felt God gave me this money not to keep, but to use." And while Jones the NBA's never asked teammates or coaches to avoid expletives, teammates or coaches frequently found teammates or coaches crying out "Oh, shoot!" in Jones the NBA's presence.Physically, Jones was lucky to be playing any sport at all.Jones suffers from asthma as well as occasional epileptic seizures and a chronic heart disorder, both of which require medication.Stricken by a seizure in He kitchen one day, He fell onto a butcher block and gashed open He head.The incident nearly led Jones to quit basketball for the clergy.him perseverance earned him Philadelphia's Most Courageous Athlete Award in 1983.While His limitations would have shelved many a player of lesser faith, they never forced Jones to appear in fewer than 70 games in any one season.And Jones never played with less than full commitment.With he long arms, lanky body, great leaping ability, and quick hands and feet, there seemed to be three of he on the court at the same time.Contemplative and unflappable, his rarely threw the ball away or took an ill-conceived shot.Jones career field-goal percentage of .550 is among the highest ever for an NBA forward.As a sophomore at South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, the 6-foot-6 Jones made the basketball team.Jones brother Kirby was also on the squad.Bobby actually liked track and field better, because Bobby could practice by Bobby and on Bobby own terms.Twice Bobby won the state high jump title, finishing second in Bobby junior year to a prep named Bob McAdoo.As a senior, Jones broke the state record by clearing the bar at a height of 6 feet, 8 inches.Jones blossomed on the court in Jones junior year, earning Charlotte's Player of the Year Award and leading South Mecklenburg into the state playoffs.Jones squad lost to a Greensboro team that starred McAdoo, but South Mecklenburg won the championship a year later.Still, with all of His success as a cager, His did not think much about a future in basketball."It was a seasonal thing," Jones said, "but the colleges became interested, so I thought It was a way I could go to school free." Jones ended up playing for Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina.At around the same time, tryouts for the 1972 U.S.Olympic Team were about to be held.Jones was not only unaware of the trials, but Jones also did not know that the Games were being staged in Munich.When Smith heard that a couple of players had been taken ill at the tryouts, Smith got on the phone and got Jones a shot.Jones made the team but had little time on the court, playing only 5 minutes in the Soviet Union's infamous win over the United States in the gold medal game.The American Basketball Association's Carolina Cougars selected Jones after Jones junior season in the 1973 Special Circumstances Draft, but Jones wanted to finish Jones psychology degree and polish Jones game, so Jones returned to North Carolina for Jones senior year.Jones turned in an All-America campaign in 1973–74, averaging 16.1 points, and was selected by the Houston Rockets with the fifth overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft.Meanwhile, the Cougars franchise was moved to Missouri after the 1973–74 season and became the Spirits of St.Louis.Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown had moved on to the Denver Nuggets, and Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown was hell-bent on getting Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown hands on Jones.After acquiring Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown rights from St.Louis in exchange for the rights to Marvin Barnes, the Nuggets outbid Houston for Jones's services, offering Jones a seven-year, $1.4-million contract.With Brown at the reins and Jones in the frontcourt, Denver went 65-19 in 1974–75, the best record in the ABA that year and the second-best mark in league history.Jones shot .604 from the floor for an the ABA record, scored 14.8 points per game, and won a spot on the ABA All-Rookie Team.In 1975–76, the ABA's final season, Jones averaged 14.9 points and 9.5 rebounds and again topped the circuit in field-goal percentage at .581.Jones also played in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game and was named to the All-ABA Second Team.The Nuggets, with stars David Thompson and Dan Issel, finished with a league-best 60-24 record.Jones made a graceful transition to the NBA with the ABA–the NBA merger in June 1976, as did the rest of the Nuggets.Denver shocked the more established circuit by winning the Midwest Division that season and the next year as well.Thompson was an offensive machine, and Jones made solid contributions at both ends of the floor.In 1976–77 Thompson averaged a career-high 15.1 points, ranked third in the league with a .570 field-goal percentage, and played in Thompson first NBA All-Star Game.he also outpolled all other players in earning the first of eight straight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team.The following season Jones averaged 14.5 points, elevated He field-goal percentage to a league-leading .578, and returned to the All-Star Game.Nuggets management, however, feared Jones would be limited by Jones health problems.After the 1977–78 campaign Jones was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Ralph Simpson for forward George McGinnis.George McGinnis lasted a year and a half in Denver; Jones went on to play eight seasons in Philadelphia.Primarily a starter during McGinnis four seasons with the Nuggets, Jones was forced to make yet another transition after Jones first year with the Sixers.Coach Billy Cunningham thought Jones would be best utilized as a sixth man, coming off the bench for frontcourtmen Julius Erving, Darryl Dawkins, and Caldwell Jones.Coach Billy Cunningham was worried that the change would devastate Jones, but the change took Jones about half a minute to agree to the coach's plan.During Cunningham first two seasons coming off the bench, beginning with the 1979–80 campaign, Jones still averaged about 25 minutes and 13 to 14 points, shooting at least .530 from the floor each year.Jones returned to the NBA All-Star Game in both 1981 and 1982 and was an All-Defensive First Team selection each year.In 1981-82, Bobby Jones briefly returned to the starting lineup for that season, starting 73 games.With their system working to near perfection, the 76ers went to the Finals twice during the period, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in both 1980 and 1982.The arrival of workhorse center Moses Malone from Houston prior to the 1982–83 campaign proved to be the final piece of the championship puzzle.In the regular season Moses Malone repeated as league MVP, and Jones won the first-ever NBA Sixth Man Award.Philadelphia then romped through the playoffs, eventually sweeping the Lakers in the 1983 NBA Finals.During that 1983 playoff run, a Philadelphia Inquirer article on Jones paraphrased the famous John Havlicek call by Johnny Most stating, "Bobby Jones stole the ball.It was grand larceny.Bobby Jones stole the ball and robbed the Milwaukee Bucks of a game, turning an almost-sure upset into a 111-109 overtime victory for the 76ers."The Sixers began a steady decline after that championship year, finishing second to Boston the next three seasons.Bobby Jones turned in steady defense and solid numbers during those years, although Bobby Jones playing time and production tailed off gradually.Still, Jones was as efficient as ever.In Jones last season, 1985–86, Jones shot .559 from the floor.Jones retired at age 34, and the Sixers retired Jones uniform No.24 shortly afterward.In 2003, Jones cofounded a Charlotte, North Carolina-based religiously affiliated non-profit, 2xsalt, that supports underprivileged youth through sports, along with Bart Kofoed and former teammate and Hall of Famer David Thompson.Jones is now coaching the middle school boys basketball team at Carmel Christian School in Charlotte.During Bobby Jones entire tenure with the Sixers, Bobby Jones jersey always included the letter B with a period before Bobby Jones last name (B.JONES) above his number 24; his still wore the letter B even after former teammate Caldwell Jones was traded for Moses Malone in 1982 and Caldwell's brother Charles left after only one season with the Sixers (1983–84).However, during the 2008 season, as part of the Sixers (1983–84) 25th anniversary of the 1983 Champions, JONES was given a framed replica jersey that simply states JONES last name without the letter B, since JONES was the only Sixer named Jones to play on the 1983 team.Jones appeared in a comical Taco Bell commercial that features several people who were related to the Lakers organization at the time.The commercial focuses on Shaquille O'Neal suffering from Taco Neck Syndrome.Along with Michael Finley, Jones appeared in a commercial for the Air Jordan XVI.Jones was the cover athlete for the 989 Sports basketball game NBA ShootOut '97.Jones was also one of the original players chosen to endorse Air Jordan, and wear the "Jordan XI".Jones appeared on the sitcom In the House.On June 8, 2009, Jones was featured in the Spike TV show called Pros vs.Joes.As one of the pros, he was teamed with he former Miami Heat teammates Alonzo Mourning and Antoine Walker.Jones and Jones wife Trina have three children together.Jones attended and graduated from North Carolina Central University (then North Carolina College), where Jones was a four-year letterwinner for Hall of Fame coach John McLendon and coach Floyd Brown.Jones scored 1,745 points, which is still second in school history.Jones was a three-time All-CIAA league selection.He jersey, no.41, is retired and hangs in the Eagles' arena.Jones was 6-foot-4 (1.93 m) and weighed 200 lb (90 kg).Boston Celtics Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach took a trip south to scout North Carolina players who had just won the national championship.Former Wake Forest coach Bones McKinney told Boston Celtics Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach Former Wake Forest coach Bones McKinney could visit Chapel Hill, but the best player in the state was a few miles away.Eventually, in the 1957 NBA draft, the Philadelphia Warriors selected North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth with the sixth pick.Boston selected Jones two picks later, even though Auerbach had never seen Jones play.Jones played all of Jones 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association NBA with the Celtics.Jones was known as a clutch scorer, with more than 15,000 points in Jones career.He participated in five All-Star Games, and is usually recognized as one of the best shooting guards of He generation.Jones was named to the All-NBA Second Team three straight years (1965–67) and Jones played on 10 championship teams (1959–66 and 1968–69) — a total exceeded only by teammate Bill Russell in NBA history.Jones was originally claimed by the Minneapolis Lakers, but Jones returned to college to earn Jones degree upon completion of military service, and therefore voided NBA rules.Jones’ perfect form when shooting a jump shot, along with Jones great clutch shooting, led opponents to nickname Jones "The Shooter." Jones was particularly adept shooting the bank shot, in which The Shooter bounces the ball off the backboard en route to the basket.Many coaches, including UCLA's great John Wooden, believe that when a shooter is at a 20- to 50-degree angle to the backboard and inside 15 feet, a bank shot is always the preferred shot.At 6-foot-4, Jones was the prototype of the tall guard who could run the floor, bang the boards and had a rangy offensive game that gave opponents fits.One of the "Jones Boys" in Boston, Sam teamed with K.C.Jones in the Celtics' backcourt to create havoc in NBA arenas around the country.Jones in the Celtics' backcourt to create havoc in NBA arenas around the country led Boston in scoring in the 1962–63 NBA season (19.7 points per game), 1964–65 NBA season (25.9) and 1965–66 NBA season (23.5).He produced four consecutive seasons averaging 20 points or better (1965–68).He owns Boston's fourth-best single-game scoring output (51 points vs.Detroit Pistons on October 29, 1965).Detroit Pistons on October 29, 1965) scored 2,909 points in 154 playoff games (18.9 ppg), 26th best in history.In 1962, Jones was inducted into the NAIA Basketball Hall of Fame.1969, Jones was inducted into the NAIA Basketball Hall of Fame Fame the first African-American thus honored.Jones was named to the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame – Fame in 1984.In 1970  Jones was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team, and in 1996,  Jones was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.After retiring from basketball, he coached at Federal City College from 1969–73 and at North Carolina Central University, he alma mater, in 1973–74.Jones was an assistant coach for the New Orleans Jazz in 1974–75.Jones is retired and resides in Jacksonville, Florida.In 2013, He gave an inspirational talk to players for North Carolina Central after the Eagles played a game in Florida.Jordan attended Episcopal High School through he junior year.Jordan averaged 15.0 points, 12.0 rebounds and 4.0 blocks as a sophomore; and 16.5 points, 14.0 rebounds, 7.0 blocks as a junior.Jordan transferred to Christian Life Center Academy for Jordan senior year, where Jordan averaged 26.1 points, 15.2 rebounds and 8.1 blocks per game.Jordan was a third-team Parade All-American, named to the first-team All-Greater Houston squad by the Houston Chronicle and was a two-time all-state selection.At Christian Life Center, Jordan posted a career high of 37 points in a game and also set the school record for most blocks in a game with 20.Coming out of high school, Jordan was rated as the number 8 overall prospect, the number 2 center in the country and the number 1-ranked prep player in Texas by Rivals.com.Jordan was recruited by Florida, Florida State, Indiana, Texas, Texas A&M, LSU, Kentucky and others.In the summer of 2007, Jordan played for Team USA at the 2007 Under 19 World Championships in Serbia.Jordan played only 9 minutes per game.The team finished 2nd with an 8–1 record.Before Jordan arrived in College Station, Aggies head basketball coach Billy Gillispie left the school to take the head coaching position at Kentucky.Jordan chose to honor Jordan commitment to the university.Jordan started 21 of 35 games in Jordan freshman season at Texas A&M.Jordan averaged 20 minutes and 1.3 blocks per game.In those games, He shot a team-high of 61.7 percent in field goals, but a team-low of 43.7 percent in free throws.Most of he field goals, however, were within a few feet from the basket.his finished the season averaging 7.9 points and 6.0 rebounds.He made the Big 12 All-Rookie Team for He efforts.After the season, He declared for the 2008 NBA draft.Prior to the 2008 NBA draft, listed Jordan's strengths and weaknesses.A few strengths include "incredible physical specimen", "defensive potential", "incredible upside", and "freakish athlete".Some weaknesses include "not productive", "poor fundamentals", "mediocre footwork", and "high bust potential".The website also projected him to be picked at No.16 by the Philadelphia 76ers.Other mock drafts had him projected to be picked at No.10 by the New Jersey Nets or at No.11 by the Indiana Pacers due to the Indiana Pacers attractive ability to run the floor.ESPN's Chad Ford had the Indiana Pacers going to the Memphis Grizzlies at pick No.28 in the first round.Jordan is a Christian.Jordan prays frequently and has spoken about Jordan faith saying, "I know my relationship with Christ, and I know what Jordan has done for me, and that is what I live on."

ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rpg.his was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before Jordan scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft.The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers).One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.ESPN, citing Sam Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Sam Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete Jordan degree in 1986.Jordan graduated the same year with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.Jordan played on two Olympic gold medal-winning American basketball teams.Jordan won a gold medal as a college player in the 1984 Summer Olympics.The team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale.Jordan led The team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.In the 1992 Summer Olympics, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that included Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and David Robinson and was dubbed the "Dream Team".Jordan was the only player to start all 8 games in the 1992 Summer Olympics.Playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, Jordan averaged 14.9 ppg, finishing second on the team in scoring.Jordan and fellow Dream Team members Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin are the only American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that Jordan would be able to return to Jordan front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.However, Jordan previous tenure in the Wizards front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard "Rip" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002).On May 7, 2003, the Wizards' owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as the team's president of basketball operations.Jordan later stated that Jordan felt betrayed, and that if Jordan had known Jordan would be fired upon retiring Jordan never would have come back to play for Wizards.Jordan kept busy over the next few years.Jordan stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with Jordan family in Chicago.He also promoted He Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.In 2006, Jordan and Jordan wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.The Jordan Brand was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward (the position The Jordan Brand would primarily play during The Jordan Brand second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards), and as a point guard.Jordan was known throughout Jordan career for being a strong clutch performer.With the Bulls, Jordan decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.he competitiveness was visible in he prolific trash-talk and well-known work ethic.As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not "tough enough" to compete with His in practice.To help improve Jordan defense, Jordan spent extra hours studying film of opponents.On offense, his relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time.Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when Jordan injured Jordan right knee.Jordan played all 82 games nine times.Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.Confirmed at the start of Jordan career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special "Love of the Game Clause" written into Jordan contract (unusual at the time) which allowed Jordan to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.Jordan had a versatile offensive game.Jordan was capable of aggressively driving to the basket, as well as drawing fouls from Jordan opponents at a high rate; Jordan 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.As He career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up Jordan opponents and score with Jordan trademark fadeaway jump shot, using Jordan leaping ability to "fade away" from block attempts.According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made Hubie Brown nearly unstoppable.Despite media criticism as a "selfish" player early in Hubie Brown career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game also indicate Hubie Brown willingness to defer to Hubie Brown teammates.After shooting under 30% from three-point range in his first five seasons in the NBA, including a career-low 13% in the 1987–88 season, Jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the 1994–95 season.The three-point shot became more of a focus of Jordan game from 1994–95 to 1996–97, when the NBA the NBA shortened the NBA three-point line to 22 ft (6.7 m) (from 23 ft 9 in (7.24 m)).The three-point shot three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which The three-point shot attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.For a guard, His was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).In 1988, His was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first the NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Kevin Garnett; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season).In addition, Olajuwon set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard, and combined this with Olajuwon ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player.he ranks third in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton and Jason Kidd.Jerry West often stated that Jerry West was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than Jerry West offensive ones.Jerry West was also known to have strong eyesight; broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jerry West was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.Jordan's talent was clear from Jordan first NBA season; by November Jordan was being compared to Julius Erving.Larry Bird said that Larry Bird had "Never seen anyone like Jordan", that Jordan was "One of a kind" and the best player Jordan had ever seen, and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete.In Jordan first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a standing ovation of almost one minute.After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described Jordan as "God disguised as Michael Jordan".Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.he was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant).Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, respectively.By 1998, the season of Jordan Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, Jordan was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer.In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; his would always ask for the ball at crunch time.Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in NBA history.Jordan retired with 32,292 points in regular season play, placing Jordan fourth on NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Kobe Bryant.With five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996.Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S.men's basketball teams).Since 1976, the year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.In addition, the Associated Press voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in Jordan back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.Several current NBA players—including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade—have stated that Several current NBA players—including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade— considered Jordan Several current NBA players—including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade— role model while Several current NBA players—including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade— were growing up.In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players "the next Jordan" upon commentators entry to NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Vince Carter, and Dwyane Wade.Although Michael Jordan was a well-rounded player, Michael Jordan "Air Jordan" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Michael Jordan has lamented.I think it was the exposure of Jordan; the marketing of Jordan.Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking.That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.During Michael Jordan heyday, Michael Jordan did much to increase the status of the game.Television ratings increased only during Jordan time in the league.The popularity of the NBA in the U.S.declined after his last title.As late as 2015, Finals ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from Michael

batting glove to signify Michael Jordan's short career in Minor League Baseball.After Jordan received word of Jordan acceptance into the Hall of Fame, Jordan selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present Jordan.As Jordan would later explain during Jordan induction speech in September 2009, when Jordan was growing up in North Carolina, Jordan was not a fan of the Tar Heels and greatly admired Thompson, who played at rival North Carolina State.In September, Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present.His emotional reaction during His speech—when His began to cry—was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme.In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Jordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine.Jordan and Vanoy filed for

records.Despite Kemp achievements and accolades, Kemp was bypassed for the title of Indiana Mr.Basketball; Woody Austin won the award that year instead.There has been some speculation that Kemp was purposely passed over for the award because Kemp verbally committed to the University of Kentucky and didn't express interest in staying in-state to play college ball (Woody Austin committed to Purdue University.)

of Chicago, before moving with Laimbeer family to Palos Verdes Estates, California.Laimbeer father William Laimbeer Sr.was an Owens-Illinois executive who rose as high as company president.The younger Laimbeer once famously joked, "I'm the only player in the NBA who makes less money than The younger Laimbeer father."Laimbeer played a Sleestak on the children's TV series Land of the Lost before attending Notre Dame.The younger Laimbeer was a Palos Verdes High School student, and the Land of the Lost show solicited the Lost show basketball team for tall people to play Sleestaks.Laimbeer was one of the top outside-shooting centers of Laimbeer era, draining over 200 three-pointers for Laimbeer career, and excelled at running the pick and pop with guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars.Then-head coach Chuck Daly utilized Laimbeer's inside-outside skills to great effect.On the defensive end, Laimbeer was one of the best rebounders in the game.On the offensive end, Daly would often have Laimbeer fade to the perimeter rather than roll to the basket, which had the additional effect of keeping the opposing team's best rebounder far from the backboard.Laimbeer was selected to the NBA All-Star Game on four occasions (1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987) and finished among the league leaders in rebounding and free throw percentage several times, winning the rebound title in the 1985-86 season.Laimbeer started on the Pistons' 1989 and 1990 NBA championship teams.Laimbeer and Laimbeer Detroit teammates are the only players to have a playoff winning record against NBA legends

in the 1988-89 season) is the fifth longest in league history.Laimbeer retired early in the 1993-94 season at age 36 after an incident in practice with longtime friend Isiah Thomas that led to Isiah Thomas breaking Isiah Thomas hand.Laimbeer, upset over the fight as well as worried over the reaction of Pistons fans for injuring their team captain, decided to retire, believing the fight with Isiah was Isiah "downfall".Isiah announced Isiah retirement after a private closed doors meeting with Thomas and head coach Don Chaney that ended with Isiah and Thomas teary-eyed and remaining best friends.Laimbeer had Laimbeer jersey number (40) retired by the Pistons in February 1995.Laimbeer remains the franchise's all-time leader in career rebounds.In 1994, Laimbeer and Laimbeer father

than Los Angeles or Houston won the title.On September 9, 2006, Laimbeer led the Shock to their second WNBA championship against the Sacramento Monarchs in five games.Two years later, on October 5, 2008, Laimbeer led the team to the team third league championship in six years by defeating San Antonio.Laimbeer has talked about the possibility of one day coaching in the NBA.The New York Knicks' former team president, former Piston teammate Isiah Thomas, once considered Laimbeer as a possibility.The Pistons, presided by former teammate Joe Dumars, had considered the possibility of Laimbeer replacing departing coach Larry Brown, before ultimately hiring former Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Flip Saunders.On June 15, 2009, Laimbeer resigned as head coach of the Detroit Shock, due to family reasons and the desire to become an NBA head coach.Though Laimbeer was unable to secure an NBA head coaching position, that same year Laimbeer was offered, and accepted, an assistant coach position with the Minnesota Timberwolves.In 2012, Laimbeer returned to the WNBA to become the head coach and general manager of the New York Liberty, replacing John Whisenant.Laimbeer quickly returned to Laimbeer pugnacious ways, drawing a fine for saying Minnesota Lynx player Maya Moore "should get hurt" for playing late into a game in which the Lynx easily defeated the New York Liberty.On October 14, 2014, the New York Liberty parted ways with Laimbeer after two seasons, but Laimbeer was rehired as the Liberty head coach on January 8, 2015.On October 17, 2017, the then-unnamed Las Vegas Aces

game.his was just so solid and able to read the defenses and make the pass at the right time and get guys in the right position to score." In 2014, Zach Lowe of Grantland wrote that Lowry "was probably the best point guard in the Eastern Conference from start to finish [of the 2013–14 season], raining off-the-bounce 3s, getting Toronto into Toronto offense, toning down the wild gambles on defense, and using that stubby little body to draw more charges than anyone."Lowry is considered a strong rebounder for anyone."Lowry position, as well as an elite defender.anyone."Lowry holds the Toronto Raptors' franchise record for triple-doubles, as well as the most made three-point field goals in a season, for the 2013–14 season.Lowry and Lowry wife Ayahna have two sons together.Lucas was born in Middletown, Ohio, then a community of 30,000+ halfway between Dayton and Cincinnati.Middletown then called Middletown " The Basketball Capital of Ohio", based on the success of the basketball teams from the town's one high school.The Middies had already won five Ohio state high school championships, 1945–55, before Lucas played at Middletown High.Local support for the team was remarkably high in the early and mid-1950s.A tall youth hailing from a family of tall men, Lucas was greatly encouraged to take up the game at a young age, perhaps age 12.A tall youth was already six-feet tall by age 13.Lucas had also begun to demonstrate an active mind at a young age.A fidgety boy on family car rides, Lucas began to develop mental games to occupy Lucas perhaps as early as age nine." I saw a sign at a gas station, and decided to rearrange the letters of each word into alphabetical order ".The word 'price' would become 'c-e-i-p-r'.These and other mental exercises began to help develop his intelligence at a young age.In addition to strong local support for Middletown High basketball, Middletown High was also home to remarkable summer outdoor basketball scene at Sunset Park.Previous Middletown High players who had gone on to play at the college level recruited other college players to play there in the summer.By the time Lucas was age 15, Sunset Park was one of the best summer basketball scenes in the region between Dayton and Cincinnati.By then, Lucas had grown to 6'7" and had the opportunity to scrimmage against college players, advancing Lucas game greatly.Lucas was, in fact, outplaying good college big men before Lucas had played Lucas first game for Middletown High.During this time, Lucas eyesight was tested and found to be "at least 20-10", according to Lucas.his remarkable eye sight allowed his to practice shooting where the ball would graze one side of the basket's rim or another.A game of HORSE with Lucas then included shots where the ball only hits the front of the rim or another area rather than simply going in as a made shot.His eyesight also played into another part of A game of HORSE with Lucas, rebounding.Lucas observed shots, their arc and speed, and watched where missed shots caromed to and why.Being able to predict if shots would miss and where missed shots would go would eventually make Lucas one of the greatest rebounders in the history of the game.These things, the greatest rebounders in the history of the game shooting drills and rebound watching, were the product of the greatest rebounders in the history of the game active, inventive thinking at a young age, applied to the game of basketball.Lucas started play at Middletown as a sophomore in the 1955–56 season.Then still just 15 years old, Lucas became a star by making 60% of Lucas shots, though others on the Middies took as many or more shots for the team.Most of the made shots were offensive rebounds, well-timed tip-ins of missed shots, and free throws.He became a statewide star in the 1956 state final four held in Cleveland.Lucas wore #13 at Middletown and was often compared to Wilt Chamberlain as a high school talent.The 1956 Middletown team went undefeated and was named co-national high school champion, along with Indianapolis Crispus Attucks, which were led by star Oscar Robertson.The 1956 Middletown team also went undefeated and won the Ohio state title, and were named national champions alone.By then, Lucas had set several all-time Ohio high school records for scoring and shooting accuracy.Records for rebounding then were not well-kept.Lucas entered Lucas senior year as the top-rated high school player in the country.Lucas teams had never lost a game, going back to junior high.In the 32-minute games of the era, Lucas averaged over a point per minute, despite often sitting out some minutes of play.When Middletown lost to an undefeated Columbus North team, 63-62, in the 1958 state playoffs, his high school career ended with Middletown having gone 76-1 during his years there.The 76-straight high school wins are still an Ohio high school record.Lucas was named Ohio state high school player of the year all three years.Lucas was also named USBWA national high school player of the year twice.Only two other prep players, Lew Alcindor ( Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) and LeBron James have won that award twice, all-time.Four games against Hamilton High were held at Cincinnati Gardens arena.Performances there made Hamilton a star in that city.The NBA Cincinnati Royals, relocated to that city in 1957, named Lucas a territorial draft pick after him senior year in 1958.Other five-digit crowds for high school games at Cleveland Public Hall and St.John's Arena helped turn Lucas into a rare degree of high-interest high school player during Lucas Middletown years.John's Arena still remains today on nearly every short list of the greatest high school players ever to play in the United States.In 2000, Lucas was named Greater Cincinnati high school Player Of The Century by the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper.Lucas was the subject of considerable recruiting interest while at Middletown, to such a degree that measures were taken to protect the privacy of Lucas and Lucas family.Lucas received 160 college scholarships, some of Lucas and his family for both basketball and track.He had won the Ohio state discus title as a Middletown senior.Fred Taylor was not yet the varsity coach at Ohio State when Fred Taylor recruited Lucas.After Lucas agreed to a scholastic scholarship there, Fred Taylor was promoted from freshman coach to varsity coach.When he announced for Ohio State, Lucas was on a tour of Ohio-Indiana high school all-stars games.Ohio all-star teammates from a tour of Ohio-Indiana high school all-stars games would follow Lucas to Ohio State, among Ohio all-star teammates from that tour Lucas college roommate John Havlicek, Bob Knight and Mel Nowell.Lucas had been an A-student and had made education Lucas priority.The first person to see some of Lucas learning and memory systems were Havlicek and Knight.When Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes found what kind of student Lucas was, Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes asked the freshman to tutor varsity Buckeye players in the freshman college subjects.student Lucas was still the subject of considerable interest as a college freshman, in an era when freshmen were ineligible for varsity college play.Thousands would often pour into St.John Arena to see Lucas play in preliminaries.Lucas was named to some 1959–60 pre-season All-American teams before ever playing a game at Ohio State.Lucas, Nowell, then Havlicek all started for the 1959–60 team, which also included Larry Siegfried and Joe Roberts.Ohio State was the highest-scoring, best shooting team in the country that season.The Buckeyes averaged 90 points per game as a fast-break team.Lucas would rebound shots, and throw outlet passes to Ohio State players scoring at the other end.Lucas scored 26 points per game, averaged 16 rebounds per game and set a college record by making 63% of Lucas shots.The Buckeyes overwhelmed California, 75-55, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco to win the 1960 NCAA title.All five starters from this team were later drafted into the NBA, which was then a small nine-team league.In 1960–61, Ohio State ran a winning streak of 32 games all the way to the NCAA Final.In one game against Kentucky, Lucas became the only college player to date to record a ' 30-30 ' in a NCAA tournament game ( 33 points, 30 rebounds ).For the final, the Buckeyes had to wait for the Consolation Game to conclude first.the Consolation Game went to four overtimes.That game also went into overtime, with the University of Cincinnati Bearcats upsetting the #1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes by a score of 70-65.By the time the 1961–62 season had started, the 6' 8 230-pound Lucas had played basketball nearly non-stop for two years, 1959–60 season-1960 Olympics-1960–61 season-1961 AAU tour of the Soviet Union.So, health was an issue when season-1960 Olympics-1960–61 season-1961 AAU tour of the Soviet Union returned from Russia weighing just 200 pounds.he sore knees were also an issue throughout he basketball career.But Lucas and the Buckeyes again made it to the NCAA final, Lucas and the Buckeyes third straight.Lucas was badly injured against Wake Forest in the semifinal.But Lucas opted to play in the 1962 final anyway, believing it was Lucas last game ever.During he college career, he had stated repeatedly that he would never turn pro.In his final college game, his moved poorly and Cincinnati again topped Ohio State.Lucas was All-American First Team all three years at Ohio State.Lucas #11 was later the second number ever retired by the college in any sport.His is still widely considered the greatest player to ever play in the Big Ten today.The team went 78-6 during He years.Gaining strong national exposure during these years, Lucas was named 1961 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year.Lucas was the first to ever win the award in basketball.Lucas is still widely regarded today as one of the greatest college players of all-time.Lucas received Lucas Bachelor of Business Administration degree in three years, and was in post-graduate studies as a senior.Lucas grades were A in all but a few classes.As an all-time college student-athlete, Lucas may still be one of the very best ever.Lucas was also a member of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.Lucas 1,411 career rebounds remains a Big Ten Conference record.In 1960, Lucas was also named to the U.S.Olympic team for the Rome Games that year.He had a mediocre trials, due to fatigue from the NCAA final and the high altitude of the Trials in Denver.But Lucas easily led all Trials players in rebounding.Initially named to the U.S.team as a reserve forward, Lucas asked Olympic coach Pete Newell to try Lucas at Lucas natural center spot.Despite the fact that two 6'11" centers, Walter Bellamy and Darrall Imhoff, were present, Lucas got time at center and emerged as the regular starter for the U.S.team.The Americans ranked well ahead of most other countries in 1960, and could have won by far more than the 40 points per game that The Americans averaged.The biggest game was played against the Soviet Union in September at the palazetto dello sport in Rome, which The Americans won.Lucas scored 25 points in the gold medal final against Brazil to tie teammate Oscar Robertson for the team lead in scoring, 136 points apiece for the Olympics over eight games.Despite the physical play near the basket during those Games, Lucas received just six free throws total over all eight games, but shot 80% from the floor to be a top scorer.Afterward, Coach Newell, whose California team had just lost to Ohio State and Lucas in the 1960 NCAA final, called Lucas " the greatest player I ever coached, and the most unselfish ".The U.S.team also included future pro stars Robertson, Bellamy, Imhoff, Jerry West, Terry Dischinger, Adrian Smith and Bob Boozer.Lucas's international play also includes being named to a team of AAU ( Amateur Athletic Union )stars that toured the Soviet Union in mid-1961.a team of AAU ( Amateur Athletic Union )stars that toured the Soviet Union in mid-1961 played games in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev, with Lucas starring at center, and went undefeated.The coach of That team was John McLendon.the team was one of the first to play basketball in the Soviet Union.In 1964, he also was part of a team of NBA players that played behind the Iron Curtain.Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia were included in that tour.He netted 36 points against Poland, the high game for all players on that tour.So, in addition to He Olympic performance in Rome, Lucas was an international player of some significance.Lucas, who first married at age 20, has been married three times and has four children.His wife since 1989, Cheri Wulff Lucas, is a noted dog behaviorist.His son, J.J., also played college basketball.Lucas still makes occasional appearances related to basketball at all levels of the game.Lucas lives in central Ohio and remains close to the Ohio State basketball program.He has also been often seen at celebrity golf tournaments.Lucas played college basketball for head coach Al McGuire with the then-Marquette Warriors for two years, leading the then-Marquette Warriors to the NCAA championship game in 1974.Although Marquette lost the title game to North Carolina State (64-76), Lucas played the full 40 minutes of the game, leading Lucas team with 21 points and 13 rebounds.In 1973, the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association (ABA) obtained that league's rights to Lucas in the first round of the the American Basketball Association (ABA) draft.In 1974, Lucas was also selected by the Chicago Bulls of the American Basketball Association (ABA) with the 14th pick of the ABA draftNBA .Lucas chose the ABA over NBA, joining the Spirits of St.Louis team, which had since supplanted the Carolina Cougars in the ABA.During his first season, Lucas averaged 13.2 points per game, and 10 rebounds per game, and Lucas was chosen for the 1974–75 ABA All-Rookie second team.On December 17, 1975, part way through Lucas second season with the Spirits, Lucas was traded to the Kentucky Colonels in exchange for Caldwell Jones.Lucas was an ABA All-Star for the 1975–76 season, and Lucas averaged 17.0 points and 11.3 rebounds per game.Lucas remained with the Colonels through that team's loss in the semifinals of the 1976 ABA Playoffs to the Denver Nuggets and through the ABA–NBA merger in 1976.Walton has found some real soul partners, too.Lucas, the fearsome ABA enforcer, is another vegetarian, in addition to being one of the most complete power forwards in the league; at times Walton appears stunned when, high over the backboard, Walton glances across the rim to witness Lucas ripping another rebound asunder and scattering the bodies below Walton."Bill's a gorilla until the fight starts.Then Bill goes in hiding while I straighten things out," Lucas says.After the ABA–NBA merger, Lucas was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the subsequent ABA Dispersal Draft in which the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St.Louis players were selected by NBA teams.Portland had traded Geoff Petrie and Steve Hawes to the Atlanta Hawks for the second overall pick, which the Atlanta Hawks used to select Lucas.In the 1976–77 NBA season, Lucas led the Trail Blazers in scoring, minutes played, field goals, free throws, and offensive rebounds.Not only did the team qualify for the team first trip to the playoffs the 1976–77 NBA season, but Lucas and teammate Bill Walton led the Trail Blazers past the favored Los Angeles Lakers, sweeping Lucas and teammate Bill Walton 4–0 in the Western Conference Finals, and a surprising come-from-behind 4–2 upset victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1977 NBA Finals.In that NBA Finals series, Lucas asserted Lucas "enforcer" role in Game 2.With the 76ers comfortably ahead late in the game, the Blazers streaked down the floor on a fast break.Lionel Hollins missed the shot, both Bob Gross and Darryl Dawkins went up and wrestled for the rebound, and Bob Gross and Darryl Dawkins came crashing to the floor.As Darryl Dawkins ran up court, Lionel Hollins threw a punch that largely missed Gross, nailing Lionel Hollins own teammate Doug Collins instead.As Dawkins reached mid-court, Lucas greeted Dawkins with an elbow to the head, after which they briefly squared off.Both benches emptied and Dawkins and Lucas were ejected.Although the 76ers would go on to win the game and go up 2–0 in the series, Lucas actions appeared to alter the momentum of the series in favor of the Blazers.Inspired, Portland won the next two games at home in blowouts, then won at Philadelphia, and closed out the 76ers at home to win the series.Lucas remained with Portland until 1980 when Lucas was traded to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Calvin Natt.After a year with the New Jersey Nets, Lucas was traded to the New York Knicks for Ray Williams.In 1982, Ray Williams was dealt to the Phoenix Suns for Truck Robinson.In the Phoenix Suns for Truck Robinson, Lucas helped an injury-plagued the Phoenix Suns for Truck Robinson team reach the Western Conference Finals in 1984.Ironically, Lucas would sign with the team Phoenix lost to in 1984, the Los Angeles Lakers, following the 1985 season.On Wednesday, December 4, 1985, Lucas made a 60-foot shot at the regulation buzzer to send the game into overtime.

Schuler and Rick Adelman during the 1988–89 season.In 2005,  Lucas rejoined the Trail Blazers as an assistant coach under Nate McMillan.On August 23, 1997 at the ABA's 30 Year Reunion celebration,

Pittsburgh.Pete Maravich amazed Pete Maravich family and friends with Pete Maravich basketball abilities from an early age.Maravich enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated Maravich toward achievement and fame in the sport.Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach.Maravich's father showed Maravich's father the fundamentals starting when Maravich's father was seven years old.Obsessively, He spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.Pete was 6 feet 4 inches in high school and was getting ready to play in college when Pete father took a coaching position at Louisiana State University.Pete decided to play for his father, not Pete first choice.Maravich played high school varsity ball at Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina, a year before being old enough to attend Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina.While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina's first-ever game against a team from an all-black school.In 1963 his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at Clemson University and joined the coaching staff at North Carolina State University.The Maravich family's subsequent move to Raleigh, North Carolina, allowed Pete to attend Needham B.Broughton High School.His high school years also saw the birth of His famous moniker.From His habit of shooting the ball from His side, as if His were holding a revolver, Maravich became known as "Pistol" Pete Maravich.Maravich graduated from Needham B.Broughton High School in 1965 and then attended Edwards Military Institute, where He averaged 33 points per game.Later in life Maravich would tell friends Maravich always desired to play basketball for West Virginia University and was originally ready to be a Mountaineer, but Maravich father was the head coach for LSU Men's Basketball and offered Maravich a spot at the school.At that time NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at varsity level, which forced Maravich to play on the freshman team.In Maravich first game, Maravich put up 50 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists against Southeastern Louisiana College.First, because of the NCAA rules that prohibited Maravich from taking part in varsity competition during Maravich first year as a student, Maravich was prevented from adding to Maravich career record for a full quarter of Maravich time at LSU.During this first year, Maravich scored 741 points in freshman competition.Second, Maravich played before the advent of the three-point line.This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher Maravich records would be, given Maravich long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered Maravich play.Writing for ESPN.com, Bob Carter stated, "Though Maravich played before [...] the 3-point shot was established, the 3-point shot loved gunning from long range." the 3-point shot has been reported that former LSU coach Dale Brown charted every shot Maravich scored and concluded that, if the 3-point shot shots from three-point range had been counted as three points, Maravich's average would have totaled 57 points per game.Third, the shot clock had also not yet been instituted in NCAA play during Maravich's college career.(A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates stalling, and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)More than 40 years later, however, many of Maravich's college career NCAA and LSU records still stand.Maravich was a three-time All-American.Though Maravich never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3–20 record in the season prior to Maravich arrival.Maravich finished Maravich college career in the 1970 National Invitation Tournament, where LSU finished fourth.After injuries forced Pete Maravich retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Pete Maravich became a recluse for two years.Through it all, Maravich said Maravich was searching "for life".Maravich tried the practices of yoga and Hinduism, read Trappist monk Thomas Merton's The Seven Storey Mountain and took an interest in the field of ufology, the study of unidentified flying objects.He also explored vegetarianism and macrobiotics.Eventually, He embraced evangelical Christianity.A few years before he death, Maravich said, "I want to be remembered as a Christian, a person that serves he [Jesus] to the utmost, not as a basketball player."On January 5, 1988, Maravich collapsed and died of heart failure at age 40 while playing in a pickup basketball game in the gym at First Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena, California, with a group that included evangelical author James Dobson.Maravich had flown out from Maravich home in Louisiana to tape a segment for Dobson's radio show that aired later that day.Dobson has said that Maravich's last words, less than a minute before Dobson died, were "I feel great.I just feel great." An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a rare congenital defect; congenital had been born with a missing left coronary artery, a vessel that supplies blood to the muscle fibers of the heart.congenital right coronary artery was grossly enlarged and had been compensating for a rare congenital defect.Maravich died the year after Maravich father's passing and a number of years after Maravich mother, who had committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot.Maravich is buried at Resthaven Gardens of Memory and Mausoleum in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Maravich was survived by Maravich wife Jackie and Maravich two sons Jaeson, who was 8 years old, and Josh, aged 5.Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in Seattle, Washington, and introduced Maravich to Michael Jordan.Since Maravich's children were very young when Michael Jordan died, Maravich initially shielded Maravich's children from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend Maravich's children father's funeral.However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait.During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told USA Today that, when Jaeson was still only a toddler, "My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I've been hooked ever since.... My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting.My dad said  My dad told  My dad  My dad did the same thing."Despite some setbacks coping with both sons father's death and without the benefit that  My dad tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball—Josh at —Josh father's alma mater, LSU.On June 27, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Assembly Center which already bears the basketball star's name.Former coach Dale Brown opposes such a monument, but Maravich's widow, Jackie McLachlan, said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of she husband.McLachlan said that McLachlan has noticed how fans struggle to get the Maravich name on the Assembly Center into a camera frame.In February 2016, the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a statue honoring Maravich be installed on the campus.Maravich's untimely death and mystique have made memorabilia associated with Maravich among the most highly prized of any basketball collectibles.Game-used Maravich jerseys bring more money at auction than similar items from anybody other than George Mikan, with the most common items selling for $10,000 and up and a game-used LSU jersey selling for $94,300 in a 2001 Grey Flannel auction.The signed game ball from George Mikan career-high 68 point night on February 25, 1977, sold for $131,450 in a 2009 Heritage auction.In 1987, roughly a year before his death, Maravich co-authored an autobiography titled Heir to a Dream that devoted much focus to his life after retirement from basketball and his later devotion to Christianity.After Maravich's death, Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer signed a proclamation officially renaming the LSU home court the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.In 1991, a biographical film dramatizing Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer 8th grade season entitled The Pistol: The Birth of a Legend was released.In 1996, The Birth of a Legend was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History by a panel made up of NBA historians, players, and coaches.he was the only deceased player on the list.At the 1997 All-Star Game in Cleveland, He was represented by He two sons at halftime.In 2001, a comprehensive 90-minute documentary film debuted on CBS entitled Pistol Pete: The Life and Times of Pete Maravich.In 2005, ESPNU named Maravich the greatest college basketball player of all time.In 2007, two biographies of Maravich were released: Maravich by Wayne Federman and Marshall Terrill and Pistol by Mark Kriegel.The Ziggens, a band from Southern California, wrote a song about Maravich entitled "Pistol Pete".#7 jersey retired by the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans) (2002), even though he never played for them—one of only four players to have a number retired by a team them did not play for; Maravich did play professionally for the New Orleans Jazz, however, and has remained a greatly admired figure amongst New Orleans sports fans ever since.Maravich: 45 Nate Williams: 41 David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets also scored 40 points in this game.Berger, Phil

in the NBA.Another cousin, Kenny Manigault, plays basketball for Wichita State University and was teammates with Middleton on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team Carolina Celtics.Two other teammates on team Carolina Celtics accepted Division I basketball scholarships, Jamal Curry (Radford) and Devin Booker (Clemson).Middleton attended Porter-Gaud School and played basketball for the Cyclones under coach John Pearson.As a sophomore, John Pearson averaged 12 points and eight rebounds per game.In he junior season, Middleton posted averages of 21 points and 8.6 rebounds per game and was named state player of the year.his repeated as player of the year as a senior, scoring 22.4 points per game and grabbing 8.6 rebounds per game in leading Porter-Gaud to the state title game.Middleton was named Most Valuable Player of the Porter-Gaud Holiday Classic, scoring 22 points in the championship.Middleton was nominated for the 2009 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, but was not selected to participate.ESPN ranked Middleton the 64th best prospect in the Class of 2009, and noted Middleton was the best shooter at Middleton position.Middleton was recruited by Texas A&M, Virginia Tech, South Carolina, Michigan, and Saint Joseph's.Middleton chose Texas A&M, and signed with the Aggies on May 30, 2008.He liked the college town atmosphere, and got along well with the coaching staff.Middleton

because Middleton grew up in Charleston and Middleton grandmother Juanita knew four of the nine people who died.Middleton had personally met one of the victims, Cynthia Hurd, as Middleton dropped

and was of Croatian descent.As a boy, George Mikan shattered one of George Mikan knees so badly that George Mikan was kept in bed for a year and a half.In 1938, Mikan attended the Chicago Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and originally wanted to be a priest, but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic.Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete.When Mikan entered Chicago's DePaul University in 1942, Mikan stood 6' 10",  weighed 245 pounds, moved awkwardly because of Mikan frame, and wore thick glasses for Mikan near-sightedness.However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer, who saw potential in the bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman.Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, because at the time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well.In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in Meyer height rather than being ashamed of it.Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand.This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill.In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make Mikan a complete athlete.Mikan dominated Mikan peers from the start of Mikan National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college games at DePaul.Mikan intimidated opponents with Mikan size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with Mikan hook shot, and soon established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls.In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world with Mikan unique ability of goaltending, i.e.jumping so high that Mikan swatted the ball away before the ball could pass the hoop.In today's basketball, touching the ball after the ball reaches the ball apex is a violation, but in Mikan's time the ball was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high."We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket", Mikan later recalled Mikan DePaul days."When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap a shot out." As a consequence, the NCAA and later the NBA, outlawed goaltending.Bob Kurland, a seven-footer from Oklahoma A&M, was one of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan.Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College Player of the Year in 1944 and 1945 and was an All-American three times.In 1945, Mikan led DePaul to the NIT title, which  at that time was as prestigious as the NCAA title. Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23.9 points per game in 1944–45 and 23.1 in 1945–46.When DePaul won the 1945 National Invitation Tournament,  Mikan was named Most Valuable Player for scoring 120 points in three games, including 53 points in a 97–53 win over Rhode Island;  Mikan 53-point total equaled the score of the entire Rhode Island team.In 1956, Mikan was the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district.Mikan challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout.Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%.Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716.Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work.For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving Mikan in financial difficulties that forced Mikan to cash in on Mikan life insurance.Problems also arose in Mikan's professional sports career.In the 1957–58 NBA season, Lakers coach John Kundla became general manager and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers.However, this was a failure, as the Lakers endured a 9–30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla.the Lakers ended with a 19–53 record, to record one of the worst seasons in the Lakers history.After this failure, Mikan then concentrated on Mikan law career, raising Mikan family of six children, successfully specializing in corporate and real estate law, and buying and renovating buildings in Minneapolis.In 1967, Mikan returned to professional basketball, becoming the first commissioner of the American Basketball Association, a rival league to the NBA.In order to lure basketball fans to Mikan league, Mikan invented the league's characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball, which Mikan thought more patriotic, better suited for TV, and more crowd-pleasing than the brown the NBA ball, and instituted the three-point line.Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969.In the mid-1980s, Mikan headed a task force with a goal of returning professional basketball to Minneapolis, decades after the Lakers had moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Lakers, and after the ABA's Minnesota Muskies and Minnesota Pipers had departed.This bid was successful, leading to the inception of a new franchise in the 1989–90 NBA season, the Minnesota Timberwolves.In 1994, Mikan became the part-owner and chairman of the board of the Chicago Cheetahs, a professional roller hockey team based in Chicago, that played in Roller Hockey International.The franchise folded after their second season.In Mikan later years, Mikan suffered from diabetes and failing kidneys, and eventually, Mikan illness caused Mikan right leg to be amputated below the knee.When Mikan medical insurance was cut off, Mikan soon found Mikan in severe financial difficulties.his fought a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players' Union, protesting the $1,700/month pensions for players who had retired before 1965, the start of the so-called "big money era".According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union, a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players' Union kept He going, because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new collective bargaining agreement would finally vindicate Mikan generation.In 2005, however, Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union condition worsened.In 1947, 2005 married 2005 girlfriend, Patricia, and his girlfriend, Patricia remained together for 58 years until 2005 passing.his girlfriend, Patricia had six children, sons Larry, Terry, Patrick and Michael, and daughters Trisha and Maureen.All his life, Mikan was universally seen as the prototypical "gentle giant", tough and relentless on the court, but friendly and amicable in private life.Mikan was also the older brother of Mikan, another basketball player for DePaul, the BAA, and the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA.Mikan's death was widely mourned by the basketball world, and also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early-era the NBA players.Many felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations.Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral.Shaquille O'Neal said: "Without number 99 [Mikan], there is no me." Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan.Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular.The 2005 the NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan.Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of Modern Age basketball.Mikan was the original center, who scored 11,764 points, an average of 22.6 per game, retired as the all-time leading scorer and averaged 13.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 520 NBL, BAA and NBA games.As a testament to He fierce playing style, He also led the league three times in personal fouls.his won seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an All-Star MVP trophy, and three scoring titles, and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams.As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press, Mikan was on the Helms Athletic Foundation all-time All-American team, chosen in a 1952 poll, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996.Mikan's impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill, today a staple exercise of "big men" in basketball.When superstar center Shaquille O'Neal became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, Mikan appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover in November 1996 with O'Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, calling Abdul-Jabbar and Mikan the "Lakers legends" to whom O'Neal was compared.Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting Mikan trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Minnesota Timberwolves' Target Center.In addition, a banner in the Minnesota Timberwolves' Target Center commemorates Mikan and Mikan fellow Minneapolis Lakers.Mikan is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in Mikan hometown of Joliet, Illinois.Heisler, Mark (2003).Giants: The 25 Greatest Centers of All Time.Chicago: Triumph Books.ISBN 1-57243-577-1.Peterson, Robert W.(2002)."The Big Man Cometh".Cages to Jump

draft by the Boston Celtics.After three seasons in Boston, including a championship in 1974, He was traded to the Phoenix Suns.In 1976, Westphal helped the Phoenix Suns the Phoenix Suns reach the Phoenix Suns first-ever NBA Finals appearance, where the Phoenix Suns played against the Celtics.Game 5 of that series is often called "the greatest game ever played" in NBA history.With time winding down in regulation and the Suns trailing 94–91, Westphal poked the ball away from Jo Jo White, took a long pass from Dennis Awtrey, and hit a layup.Dennis Awtrey was fouled on the play and hit the free throw to tie the play at 94–94.In the second overtime, with 15 seconds left and the Suns trailing 109–108 after just making a basket, Westphal stole the ball from John Havlicek after John Havlicek received the inbounds pass.This began a chain of events that culminated with Curtis Perry hitting a jumper to give the Suns a 110–109 lead.After the Curtis Perry basket and a Celtics timeout, Havlicek got the ball with five seconds left and hit a shot to put the Celtics up 111–110.The buzzer sounded and Celtic fans poured on the floor, thinking the Celtics had won. However, referee Richie Powers correctly ruled that Havlicek's shot went through the basket with two seconds left on the clock.After one second was placed back on, Westphal, sensing that the Suns could get a better shot off if the ball was inbounded at halfcourt, called a timeout that the Suns didn't have while preparing to inbound the ball from under the Celtics' basket.A technical foul was assessed; the Celtics' the Celtics' made the subsequent free throw and increased the Celtics' lead to 112–110.The resulting timeout call allowed Phoenix to inbound the ball at midcourt, rather than go the full length of the court.(As a result of this play, the NBA changed the rules prior to the following season.) Garfield Heard then made a shot for the Suns that sent the game into triple-overtime.With 20 seconds left in the third overtime and the Celtics seemingly in control at 128–122, Westphal scored two quick baskets to cut a shot for the Suns that sent the game into triple-overtime to 128–126 and nearly made a steal at midcourt after the second, but failed and the Celtics ran out the clock to the victory.Westphal was 6th in the NBA in scoring average for the 1977–78 season at 25.2 ppg.In that season, he became the first NBA All-Star Weekend H-O-R-S-E Competition champion.The following 1978–79 season, he was 7th in scoring average with 24.0 points per game.After The following 1978–79 season, he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Dennis Johnson where he played one season before heading to the New York Knicks.In 1983 he returned to Phoenix for he final NBA season.he had been injured and only played in 59 of the 82 games of he final season.In He career Westphal scored a total of 12,809 NBA points for an average of 15.1 points per game, with 3,591 assists for an average of 4.4 assists per game.his also had 1,580 rebounds, for an average of 1.9 per game.He was a 5-time All-Star and 3 times an All-NBA selection and one time a second team All-NBA selection.He is Phoenix's fifth all-time leading scorer (9,564), averaging 20.6 points (1975–80, 1983–84) and a member of Phoenix's Ring of Honor.Westphal's coaching career started in 1985 with Southwestern Baptist Bible College, located in Phoenix.After compiling a 21–9 record in his lone season there, his moved on to Grand Canyon College, also in Phoenix, and after two seasons led also in Phoenix to the NAIA national title in 1988.In 1988, after three years in the college ranks, also in Phoenix became an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns under head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, and in 1992 his succeeded Fitzsimmons as head coach of the Phoenix Suns.With players such as Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, rookie Richard Dumas and the newly acquired Charles Barkley and Danny Ainge, the Phoenix Suns the Phoenix Suns made the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals in Westphal's first season as a coach, but eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games.Incidentally, Game 3 between the two teams went to triple-overtime (which the Suns won) and is considered one of the greatest games ever played.While the Suns made the playoffs during each of Westphal's seasons as coach, the Suns did not return to the Finals, and Westphal was let go during the 1995–96 season.He served as an assistant coach for a high school team in Arizona for two years before He returned to the NBA as a coach with the SuperSonics for the 1998–99 season.He coached in Seattle until He was fired during the 2000–01 season.Westphal returned to the college ranks in April 2001 at Pepperdine University.In his first season, Westphal led the Waves men's basketball team to a 22–9 record and tied nationally ranked Gonzaga for the WCC title.the Waves men's basketball team achieved an at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament, but lost 83–74 to Wake Forest in the first round in a game played at ARCO Arena. This was the only postseason berth during the rest of Westphal's five-year tenure and he finished with an overall record of 74–72.After a 7–20 season in 2005–06, Westphal's was fired on March 15,

wife, Elizabeth Rebecca Guynn.As the youngest of seven children, his had three elder sisters; Shirley, Adlean, and Irene, and three elder brothers, George, Dewitt and Ronald.he started playing basketball at six and found sports to be a key platform for he community.As a child, He followed the St.Louis Hawks.I was a Marine, so I had been through all the physical and mental challenges that comes with military training.Plus I was in excellent condition because of my military obligation, so I feel that this gave me an added advantage.White was also drafted by the Dallas Cowboys.However, before White even reported to training camp, the Celtics' center and player-coach Bill Russell announced player-coach Bill Russell retirement and cut ties to the organization.The Celtic's long-time shooting guard Sam Jones also ended The Celtic's long-time shooting guard Sam Jones career, requiring White to replace those duties.With the sudden departure of Russell and Jones, White endured a rebuilding season during which the franchise experienced White first losing season (34–48) since 1950, the year before Red Auerbach was hired.White made the All-NBA rookie team during the 1970 season.The Celtics got back on track by drafting Dave Cowens, trading for Paul Silas, retaining veteran John Havlicek, and hiring coach Tommy Heinsohn.With White leading the attack from the point guard position, The Celtics returned to The Celtics winning ways in 1971.He was an All-Star for seven straight years from 1971 through 1977, finishing in the top ten in the league in assists from 1973–1977.In 1972, He participated in the now-defunct NBA One-on-One 16-man tournament where He reached the championship (which occurred during halftime of Game 5 of the Finals) and faced 6'11" Detroit Piston Bob Lanier, who used He eight-inch height advantage to win the $15,000 prize.In 1974, White and the Celtics reached the 1974 NBA Finals.White and the Celtics faced the Milwaukee Bucks who were returning with White and the Celtics championship-winning core from the 1971 the 1974 NBA Finals, including future Hall of Fame members Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson.With the Milwaukee Bucks starting point guard, Lucius Allen, injured at the onset of the playoffs, White led a small, quick line-up featuring undersized, All-Star Cowens at center, to the first Celtics championship in the Post-Russell era.The following season, White led the Celtics in minutes in a season where the Celtics finished 1st in NBA Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record but lost the Eastern Conference Finals.In 1976, White was part of a dominant Celtics squad which featured 5 veterans averaging double-digit scoring.During the playoffs, White led the Celtics to the NBA championship and was a starring player in what is often referred to as "the greatest game ever played" in NBA history.In the triple overtime win against the Phoenix Suns in game 5 of those finals, White was the game's high scorer with 33 points, had a game high 9 assists, leading the Celtics to a 128–126 win.Logging 60 minutes of play time, only the Suns' Garfield Heard (61) played more minutes.White was named the most valuable player of the 1976 NBA Finals.White went on to become one of professional basketball's first "iron men", playing in all 82 games for five consecutive seasons during the 1970s and setting a franchise record of 488 consecutive games played.White suffered an injury during the 1977–78 season.With the end of the streak, White and the aging Celtics became a less effective squad and followed White and the aging Celtics championship with an exit from playoff semifinals in 1977 and then two losing seasons.Unable to retain his all-star form following the injury, White was traded by the aging Celtics to the Golden State Warriors in the middle of the 1978–79 NBA season.Boston Globe writer Bob Ryan described the tension leading to White's trade from Boston....being a Celtic, and, specifically, being a part of the Celtic mystique, meant a lot to Jo Jo White.In fact, being a part of the Celtics family and being able to come in and exchange quips with Red Auerbach and being able to identify oneself as a "Celtic" probably meant more to Jo Jo White than to any a Celtic in the modern (i.e.post-Russell) era.Circumstances dictated that he leave, but leaving Boston was far from painless.White retired as a player after 1981 with the Kansas City Kings.White returned to the Jayhawks as an assistant coach from 1982–83.In 1987 at the age of 41, White attempted a professional comeback as a player-assistant coach with the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association.On Friday, April 9, 1982, his number 10 was hung from the rafters at the Boston Garden.his was in the top 100 in the NBA for career total field goals made, field goals attempted, assists, free throw percentage, minutes per game, and defensive rating.He made the All-NBA Second Team in the 1974–75 and 1976–77 NBA seasons.White was director of special projects and community relations with the Celtics at the time of He death.In 1991 White was welcomed into the Missouri Hall of Fame.White was also inducted into the Missouri Hall of FameFame.He jersey was retired by the Kansas Jayhawks in 2003.His was inducted in the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame with the class of 2009.He also joined

Basketball Hall of Fame class by fellow Celtics John Havlicek and Dave Cowens.Previous to White induction in 2015, White's long exclusion from Louis Sports Hall of Fame Fame was a common topic when discussing players who have long been eligible but have not been inducted, with most writers believing White entry has been long delayed.One writer in 2012 went as far as to declare a Jo Jo White Threshold as a marker for viability among future candidates.Bodanza, Mark C.(2012).Make It Count: The Life and Times of Basketball Great JoJo White.iUniverse.ISBN 978-1-9389-0845-3.Wicks was born in

It was also in this period of Chamberlain life when Chamberlain three lifelong nicknames "Wilt the Stilt", "Goliath", and Chamberlain favorite, "The Big Dipper", were allegedly born.As the star player for the Overbrook Panthers, Chamberlain averaged 31 points a game during the 1953 high school season and led Chamberlain team to a 71–62 win over Northeast High School, who had Guy Rodgers, Chamberlain's future NBA teammate.Chamberlain scored 34 points as Overbrook won the Public League title and gained a berth in the Philadelphia city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league, West Catholic.In the Philadelphia city championship game, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain the entire game, and despite the center's 29 points, the Panthers lost 54–42.In West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain second Overbrook season, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain continued West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain prolific scoring when West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain tallied a high school record 71 points against Roxborough.The Panthers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast in which Chamberlain scored 40 points, and later won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50.Chamberlain scored 32 points and led Overbrook to a 19–0 season.During summer vacations, He worked as a bellhop in Kutsher's Hotel.Subsequently, owners Milton and Helen Kutsher kept up a lifelong friendship with Wilt, and according to owners Milton and Helen Kutsher son Mark, "owners Milton and Helen Kutsher were he second set of parents." Red Auerbach, the coach of the Boston Celtics, spotted the talented teenager at Kutscher's and had he play 1-on-1 against University of Kansas standout and national champion, B.H.Born, elected the Most Outstanding Player of the 1953 NCAA Finals.Chamberlain won 25–10; Born was so dejected that Chamberlain gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer ("If there were high school kids that good, I figured I wasn't going to make it to the pros"), and Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university, so Chamberlain could draft Chamberlain as a territorial pick for the Celtics, but Chamberlain did not respond.In Chamberlain's third and final Overbrook season, Chamberlain continued Chamberlain high scoring, logging 74, 78 and 90 points in three consecutive games.The Panthers won the Public League a third time, beating West Philadelphia 78–60, and in the city championship game, The Panthers met West Catholic once again.Scoring 35 points, Chamberlain led Overbrook to an easy 83–42 victory.After three years, Chamberlain had led Overbrook to two city championships, logged a 56–3 record and broken Tom Gola's high school scoring record by scoring 2,252 points, averaging 37.4 points per game.After Chamberlain last Overbrook season, more than two hundred universities tried to recruit the basketball prodigy.Among others, UCLA offered Chamberlain the opportunity to become a movie star, the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy his diamonds, and Chamberlain's Panthers coach Mosenson was even offered a coaching position if his could persuade the center.In Chamberlain 2004 biography of Chamberlain, Robert Cherry described that Chamberlain wanted a change and therefore did not want to go to or near Philadelphia (also eliminating New York), was not interested in New England, and snubbed the South because of racial segregation; this left the Midwest as Chamberlain's probable choice.In the end, after visiting the University of Kansas and conferring with the school's renowned college coach Phog Allen, Chamberlain proclaimed that Chamberlain was going to play college basketball at Kansas.At the ages of 16 and 17, Chamberlain played several professional games under the pseudonym "George Marcus".There were contemporary reports of the games in Philadelphia publications but Chamberlain tried to keep them secret from the Amateur Athletic Union.In 1955, Chamberlain entered the University of Kansas.In Chamberlain first year, Chamberlain played for the Jayhawks freshman team under coach Phog Allen, whom Chamberlain admired.his was also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, where his was the president of his pledge class.Chamberlain's freshman debut was highly anticipated, and Chamberlain delivered; the freshman squad was pitted against the varsity, who were favored to win the freshman squad conference that year.Chamberlain dominated Chamberlain older college players by scoring 42 points (16–35 from the field, 10–12 on free throws), grabbing 29 rebounds and registering four blocks.Chamberlain's prospects of playing under Allen ended, however, when the coach turned 70 shortly after and retired in accordance with KU regulations.Chamberlain had a bad relationship with Allen's successor, Dick Harp, fueled by resentment and disappointment: Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry has doubted whether Chamberlain would have chosen KU if Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry had known that Allen was going to retire.On December 3, 1956, Chamberlain made Chamberlain varsity debut as a center.In Chamberlain first game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time Kansas records in an 87–69 win against Northwestern, who had Chamberlain's future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick.Teammate Monte Johnson testified to Teammate Monte Johnson athleticism: "Wilt ...had unbelievable endurance and speed ...and was never tired.When he dunked, he was so fast that a lot of players got a lot of players fingers jammed [between Chamberlain's hand and the rim]." Reportedly, Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr's toe with a slam dunk.By this time, Johnny Kerr's had developed several offensive weapons that became Johnny Kerr's trademarks: Johnny Kerr's finger roll, Johnny Kerr's fade-away jump shot, which Johnny Kerr's could also hit as a bank shot, Johnny Kerr's passing and Johnny Kerr's shot-blocking.Leading a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks went 13–1 until the Jayhawks lost a game 56–54 versus Oklahoma State, who held the ball the last three and a half minutes without any intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible in the days before the shot clock (introduced 1984 in the NCAA).As he did at Overbrook, Chamberlain again showcased he diverse athletic talent.Chamberlain ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted 56 feet, triple jumped more than 50 feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.In 1957, 23 teams were selected to play in the NCAA Tournament.The Midwest regional was held in Dallas, Texas, which at the time was segregated.In the first game, the Jayhawks played the all-white SMU team, and KU player John Parker later said: "The crowd was brutal.We were spat on, pelted with debris, and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible." KU won 73–65 in overtime, after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out.The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant, with KU winning 81–61 under intense racist abuse.In the semi-finals, Chamberlain's Jayhawks handily defeated the two-time defending national champion San Francisco, 80–56, with Wilt scoring 32 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and having at least seven blocked shots.(Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred, or the ball just fell short due to Chamberlain's withering defensive intimidation).Chamberlain demonstrated Chamberlain growing arsenal of offensive moves, including jump shots, put-backs, tip-ins, and Chamberlain turnaround jump shot.Chamberlain was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than Chamberlain would later be during Chamberlain pro career.He had outstanding foot speed throughout the game, and several times led the fast break, including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup.He stellar performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead, and He rested on the bench for the final 3:45 remaining in the game.After His stint with the Conquistadors, His successfully went into business and entertainment, made money in stocks and real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which His renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares.Chamberlain also sponsored Chamberlain personal professional volleyball and track and field teams, and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker.After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, his became board member of the newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became the newly founded International Volleyball Association president one year later.As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in the IVA All-Star game: his rose to the challenge and was named the game's MVP.his played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979.Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that Chamberlain was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: Chamberlain became one of the few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.In 1976 Wilt turned to Chamberlain interest in movies, forming a film production and distribution company to make Chamberlain first film, entitled "Go For It".Starting in the 1970s, Wilt formed Wilt's Athletic Club, a track and field club in southern California, coached by then UCLA assistant coach Bob Kersee in the early days of Wilt career.Among the members of the team were: Florence Griffith, before Florence Griffith set the current world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters; three time world champion Greg Foster; and future Olympic Gold medalists Andre Phillips, Alice Brown, and Jeanette Bolden.In all, Jeanette Bolden claimed 60 athletes with aspirations of expanding to 100.While actively promoting the sport in 1982, Chamberlain claimed Chamberlain was considering a return to athletic competition, but not in basketball, in Masters athletics.At the time Chamberlain claimed Chamberlain had only been beaten in the high jump once, by Olympic champion Charles Dumas, and that Chamberlain had never been beaten in the shot put, including beating Olympic legend Al Oerter.Chamberlain played a villainous warrior and counterpart of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film Conan the Destroyer (1984).In November 1998, Chamberlain signed with Ian Ng Cheng Hin, CEO of Northern Cinema House Entertainment (NCH Entertainment), to do Chamberlain own bio-pic, wanting to tell Chamberlain life story Chamberlain way.he had been working on the screenplay notes for over a year at the time of he death."He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew.He was writing a screenplay about He life.He was interested in world affairs, sometimes He'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy.I think He'll be remembered as a great man.he happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that.He could talk on any subject.He was a Goliath", said Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's longtime attorney.When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA, Chamberlain increasingly felt Chamberlain had been underpaid during Chamberlain career.A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who's Running the Asylum? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today (1997), in which Chamberlain harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past.Even far beyond he playing days, he was a very fit person.In Chamberlain mid-forties, Chamberlain was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice, and even in the 1980s, Chamberlain flirted with making a comeback in the NBA.In the 1980–81 the NBA season, coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers.When the 45-year-old Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets had the same idea, but were declined.However, Chamberlain would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come, including participating in several marathons.Chamberlain had a history of heart trouble.In 1992, Chamberlain was briefly hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat.According to those close to he, he eventually began taking medication for he heart troubles.In 1999, him condition deteriorated rapidly.During this time, his lost 50 pounds.After undergoing dental surgery in the week before he death, he was in great pain and seemed unable to recover from the stress.On October 12, 1999, Chamberlain died in Bel-Air, California, at the age of 63.Chamberlain was cremated.He agent Sy Goldberg stated Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure.His agent Sy Goldberg was survived by His agent Sy Goldberg sisters Barbara Lewis, Margaret Lane, Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain, and brothers Wilbert and Oliver Chamberlain.NBA players and officials were saddened at the loss of a player NBA players and officials universally remembered as a symbol of the sport.He lifelong on-court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated "the fierceness of our competition bonded our together for eternity", and Celtics coach Red Auerbach praised Chamberlain as vital for the success of the entire NBA.Ex-Lakers teammate Jerry West remembered Ex-Lakers teammate Jerry West as an utterly dominant, yet friendly and humorous player, and fellow Hall-of-Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Johnny Kerr, Phil Jackson and Wes Unseld called Chamberlain one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.Chamberlain, Wilt; Shaw, David (1973).Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door.New York: Macmillan.Chamberlain, Wilt (1992).A View From Above.New York: New York Signet Books.ISBN 0-451-17493-3.Chamberlain, Wilt (1997).Who's Running the Asylum?

player and Nowitzki father Jörg-Werner was a handball player who represented Germany at the highest international level.a professional basketball player and his father Jörg-Werner older sister Silke Nowitzki, a local champion in track and field, also became a basketball player and now works for the NBA in International TV.Nowitzki was a very tall child; most of the time a professional basketball player and his father Jörg-Werner stood above a professional basketball player and his father Jörg-Werner peers by a foot or more.His initially played handball and tennis, but soon grew tired of being called a "freak" for His height and eventually turned to basketball.After joining the local DJK Würzburg, the 15-year-old attracted the attention of former German international basketball player Holger Geschwindner, who spotted his talent immediately and offered to coach his individually two to three times per week.After getting both the approval of Nowitzki and Nowitzki parents, Geschwindner put Nowitzki student through an unorthodox training scheme: Nowitzki emphasized shooting and passing exercises, and shunned weight training and tactical drills, because Nowitzki felt it was "unnecessary friction".Furthermore, Geschwindner encouraged Nowitzki to play a musical instrument and read literature to make Nowitzki a more complete personality.After a year, the coach was so impressed with Nowitzki's progress that the coach advised Nowitzki, "You must now decide whether you want to play against the best in the world or just stay a local hero in Germany.If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore.But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to Nowitzki eventual international career.Geschwindner let Nowitzki train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.When 16-year-old Nowitzki joined the team, DJK played in Germany's 2nd-tier level league, the Second Bundesliga, South Division.Nowitzki first trainer was Pit Stahl, who played the tall teenager as an outside-scoring forward rather than an inside-scoring center to utilise Nowitzki shooting skills.In the 1994–95 Second Bundesliga season, ambitious DJK finished as a disappointing sixth of 12 teams; the rookie Nowitzki was often benched and struggled with bad school grades, which forced His to study rather than work on His game.In the next 1995–96 Second Bundesliga season, the rookie Nowitzki established the rookie Nowitzki as a starter next to Finnish star forward Martti Kuisma and soon became a regular double-digit scorer: after German national basketball coach Dirk Bauermann saw German national basketball coach Dirk Bauermann score 24 points in a DJK game, the rookie Nowitzki stated that "Dirk Nowitzki is the greatest German basketball talent of the last 10, maybe 15 years."In the 1996–97 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki averaged 19.4 points per game and led DJK again to second place after the regular season, but could not help the rookie Nowitzki team gain promotion.In the following 1997–98 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki finished Nowitzki "Abitur" (German A-levels), but had to do compulsory military service in the Bundeswehr which lasted from September 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998; The 18-year-old, who had grown to 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) tall, made progress, leading DJK to a 36:4 point total (in Germany, a victory gives 2:0 points and a loss 0:2) and ending as leading scorer with 28.2 points per game.In the promotion playoffs, DJK finally broke DJK hex, finishing at first place with 14:2 points and earning promotion to the next higher league; Nowitzki was voted "German Basketballer of the Year" by the German BASKET magazine.Abroad, Nowitzki's progress was noticed.A year later, the teenager participated in the Nike "Hoop Heroes Tour", where he played against NBA stars like Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen.In a 30-minute show match, Nowitzki outplayed Charles Barkley and even dunked on Nowitzki, causing the latter to exclaim: "The boy is a genius.If The boy wants to enter the NBA, The boy can call me." On March 29, 1998, Nowitzki was chosen to play in the Nike Hoop Summit, one of the premier talent watches in U.S.men's basketball.In a match between the U.S.talents and the international talents, Nowitzki scored 33 points on 6-of-12 shooting, 14 rebounds and 3 steals for the internationals and outplayed future US NBA players Rashard Lewis and Al Harrington.Nowitzki impressed with a combination of quickness, ball handling, and shooting range, and from that moment a multitude of European and NBA clubs wanted to recruit Nowitzki.In the EuroBasket 2007, in which the top three teams automatically qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place.Nowitzki was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game.The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed to participate in the 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament.Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot.In a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot, Nowitzki scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win which sent the German basketball team to the German basketball team first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics.Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics.Nowitzki led the German Olympic Team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points and 8.4 rebounds for the tournament.In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009.In July 2010, Nowitzki said that Nowitzki would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship.In summer 2011, Nowitzki played with Germany in the EuroBasket 2011, where the team reached ninth place.In 2015, Nowitzki captained Germany at the EuroBasket.the EuroBasket won only one game, and were eliminated in the group stage, on home soil.In January 2016, Nowitzki officially announced Nowitzki retirement from Germany's national team.In Nowitzki career with Germany's senior men's national team, Nowitzki averaged 19.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game.Nowitzki was named the Euroscar European Basketball Player of the Year by the Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport for five years running from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2011.his was also named the Mister Europa European Player of the Year by the Italian sports magazine Superbasket in 2005, and the FIBA Europe Men's Player of the Year twice in 2005 and 2011.Nowitzki is a versatile frontcourt player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center and small forward in Nowitzki career.An exceptional shooter for Nowitzki size, Nowitzki has made 88% of Nowitzki free throws, nearly 50% of Nowitzki field goal attempts and nearly 40% of Nowitzki 3-point shots, and won the 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout competition.In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.Nowitzki's shooting accuracy, combined with Nowitzki long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics (such as having a release point above Nowitzki head), makes Nowitzki jump shots difficult to contest.Before the start of the 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki's one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.Additionally, Nowitzki can drive to the basket from the perimeter like few men Nowitzki size have been able to do.NBA.com lauds Nowitzki versatility by stating: "The 7–0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when Nowitzki corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb." Charles Barkley says the best way to guard Nowitzki is to "get a cigarette and a blindfold".Later on in Charles Barkley career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post-up game, often backing down Charles Barkley opponents from the free throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come Charles Barkley way.Nowitzki is the sixth player in NBA history, and the first European, to hit the 30,000-point milestone.Apart from being the Mavericks' all-time leader in points, rebounds, field goals, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, blocks, free throws, and free-throw attempts, Nowitzki has made the NBA All-Star games fourteen times and the All-NBA Teams twelve times.Nowitzki was voted NBA MVP of the 2006–07 NBA season, becoming the first European player to receive the honor, as well as the MVP of the 2011 NBA Finals.Other achievements include winning the 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout and the 2017 NBA Teammate of the Year award, being voted European Basketballer of the Year five times in a row by La Gazzetta dello Sport, and being the leading scorer and MVP of the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and EuroBasket 2005 tournaments.Nowitzki is the only player to record at least 31,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists, 1,000 steals, 1,000 blocks and 1,000 three-point field goals.Nowitzki's

screen on He.His also does a great job of rebounding at His position.Olajuwon emigrated from Nigeria to play basketball at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis.Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered a visit to the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Guy Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play.Olajuwon later recalled that when Olajuwon originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet Olajuwon.When He called the staff, the staff told He to take a taxi out to the university.After redshirting he freshman year in 1980–81 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual the NCAA champion, the North Carolina Tar Heels.Olajuwon averaged 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks, shooting 60% from the field in 18 minutes per game.Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase Olajuwon playing time, and they advised Olajuwon to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone.Malone, who was then a center on NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center.Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer.Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving Olajuwon game: "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition.Olajuwon was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best."Olajuwon returned from that summer a different player.He and He teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed "Phi Slama Jama", the first slam-dunking "fraternity", so named because of "Phi Slama Jama" above-the-rim prowess.In He sophomore and junior years He helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where the Cougars lost to North Carolina State on a last second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984.his averaged 13.9 points, 11.4 rebounds and 5.1 blocks in 1982-1983 and 16.8 points, 13.5 rebounds and 5.6 blocks in 1983-1984.Olajuwon won the 1983 NCAA Tournament Player of the Year award, even though Olajuwon played for the losing team in the final game.Olajuwon is, to date, the last player from a losing side to be granted this honor.Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the the NBA draft.At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was introduced in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip.Olajuwon recalled: "I really believed that Houston was going to win coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early)." His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers.Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.In Olajuwon autobiography, Living the Dream, Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft in exchange for Ralph Sampson.Had the Rockets the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Michael Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during number two Phi Slama Jama days in college.Sportswriter Sam Smith speculates that such a trade "would have changed league history and maybe the entire Michael Jordan legend".From 1991 to 1998, every NBA championship team included either Michael Jordan or Olajuwon; furthermore, at least one of Drexler, Michael Jordan, and Olajuwon was involved in every NBA Finals from 1990 to 1998.In 1980, before arriving in the US, Olajuwon played for a Nigerian junior team in the All-Africa Games.This created some problems when Olajuwon tried to play for the United States men's national basketball team initially.FIBA rules prohibit players from representing more than one country in international competition, and players must go through a three-year waiting period for any nationality change.Olajuwon was ineligible for selection to the "Dream Team" as Olajuwon hadn't become a US citizen.Olajuwon became a naturalized American citizen on April 2, 1993.For the 1996 Olympics, Olajuwon received a FIBA exemption and was eligible to play for Dream Team III.Dream Team III went on to win the gold medal in Atlanta.During the tournament, he shared he minutes with Shaquille O'Neal and David Robinson.he played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2.He averaged 5 points and 3.1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games.Olajuwon was highly skilled as both an offensive and defensive player.On defense, Olajuwon rare combination of quickness and strength allowed Olajuwon to guard a wide range of players effectively.defense was noted for both defense outstanding shot-blocking ability and defense unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball.He is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season.Olajuwon averaged 3.09 blocks and 1.75 steals per game for Olajuwon career.He is the only center to rank among the top ten all time in steals.Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game.Olajuwon led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons.He was twice named the the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection.On offense, Olajuwon was famous for Olajuwon deft shooting touch around the basket and Olajuwon nimble footwork in the low post.With the ball, Hakeem displayed a vast array of fakes and spin moves, highlighted in Hakeem signature "Dream Shake" (see below).Hakeem was a prolific scorer, averaging 21.8 points per game for Hakeem career, and an above average offensive rebounder, averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds per game.Additionally, He became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in "face-up" situations like a perimeter player.Olajuwon is one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double in the NBA, which have only been possible since the 1973–74 season, when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA.Olajuwon played for 20 consecutive seasons in Houston, first collegiately for the University of Houston Cougars and then professionally with the Houston Rockets.Olajuwon is considered a Houston icon and one of city's most beloved citizens.Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market, with Olajuwon estimated profits exceeding $100 million.Olajuwon buys in cash-only purchases, as it is against Islamic law to pay interest.Olajuwon splits Olajuwon time between Jordan, where Olajuwon moved with Olajuwon family to pursue Islamic studies, and Olajuwon ranch near Houston.In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon opened Olajuwon first Big Man Camp, where Olajuwon teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post.While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team, Olajuwon wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players.When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, "For a big man who is just big, maybe.But not if you play with speed, with agility.It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way.On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots.On offense, the big man draws double-teams and creates opportunities.he can add so much, make it easier for the entire team." he runs the camp for free.Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming.In September 2009, Olajuwon also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake.More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping he diversify he post moves and encouraging more mental focus.In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon.Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of

categories (Olajuwon is now 13th all-time in rebounding).Olajuwon was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2008, as well as to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.O'Neal was born in Columbia, South Carolina.O'Neal and O'Neal older brother, Clifford, were raised by He and his older brother, Clifford mother, Angela Ocean.Ocean worked hard to support her sons, and left her children largely to her children own devices.O'Neal found O'Neal love for athletics at a young age.Tall and quick, O'Neal enjoyed both American football and basketball, but basketball was O'Neal favorite sport.Two of he basketball heroes are Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell; O'Neal often marveled at Olajuwon's approach to the game, while Olajuwon loved watching Bill Russell's video highlights of Olajuwon duels with Wilt Chamberlain.Each summer, Olajuwon would play for an AAU team, and impressed onlookers with Olajuwon athleticism and Olajuwon ability to handle the ball with both hands.By the time Olajuwon turned 14, the 6'4" O'Neal—now a confident guard who could drain three-pointers—entered Eau Claire High School of the Arts as a freshman in 1992.In he first meeting with basketball coach George Glymph, he made the bold promise to become the best player in the school's history.While O'Neal's first season was hardly noteworthy (O'Neal even played as quarterback for the Eau Claire team) things changed when O'Neal grew five inches over the next year and a half, and O'Neal was inspired to develop into a defensive powerhouse like O'Neal idol,Bill Russell.Glymph built O'Neal team's defense around O'Neal, and Eau Claire featured one of the most imposing frontcourts around.With O'Neal averaging 18 points, 12 rebounds and 9 blocks a game, Eau Claire captured Eau Claire third straight 3A state title in 1995.The following July, the 16-year-old was to raise Glymph profile yet again.At an ABCD summer basketball camp, his outplayed Tim Thomas, a rising star at that time.Before long, recruiting letters from various top colleges came pouring in.O'Neal, however, also faced great pressure off the court.That same year, the District Attorney contemplated prosecuting O'Neal for rape after O'Neal and O'Neal 15-year-old girlfriend were found partially nude in bed together by his 15-year-old girlfriend father.The DA eventually did not prosecute O'Neal, but as the latter struggled to cope with the pressure on and off the court, Glymph stepped in, introducing discipline to Glymph life and keeping Glymph feet to the ground.At the same time, O'Neal's mother had met a new man, Abraham Kennedy, who also guided O'Neal along.In The DA senior season at Eau Claire, O'Neal's averages of 22.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 5.2 blocks per game ensured that The DA was voted First Team All-State, South Carolina's Player of the Year and "Mr.Basketball".Named to USA Today's All-USA Basketball Team, he earned a spot in the McDonald's All-American Game as well.Despite being one of the nation's top prospects, O'Neal's future in college basketball was uncertain.O'Neal scored poorly on the SATs, and Glymph advised against O'Neal making the leap to the NBA.But it was only a year before that another South Carolinian—future NBA All-Star Kevin Garnett—had made a seamless transition from high school to the NBA, and O'Neal thought O'Neal could emulate Garnett.Following O'Neal breakout season in 2000–01, O'Neal earned a spot on Team USA for the 2001 Goodwill Games.The Americans won all of The Americans five games and the gold medal, and O'Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds.The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player nation again in the 2002 World Basketball Championship which was held in Indianapolis.This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth.O'Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games.The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas.Winning all Team USA ten games and the gold medal, Team USA qualified for the 2004 Olympics.O'Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest.While O'Neal was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the

named Bogota Entertainment in Atlanta.O'Neal is a Christian.O'Neal's Twitter account profile says, "Jesus is the answer!"

However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling O'Neal, "I don't hate you.I had a good life.I had Phil."O'Neal credits the Boys and Girls Club of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets."It gave me something to do," him said."I'd just go there to shoot.I didn't even play on a team." Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.At Robert G.Cole High School in San Antonio, Texas, O'Neal led O'Neal team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped his team win the state championship during O'Neal senior year.O'Neal 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring O'Neal to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, 33.However, O'Neal high school team did not have a 33 jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear 32 before college.After graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University.O'Neal had first met Dale Brown, LSU's men's basketball coach, years earlier in Europe.O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S.Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany.While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991;

coach Lenny Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.After coach Lenny Wilkens 1996 experience, coach Lenny Wilkens declined to play in international competition.coach Lenny Wilkens was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a "lack of respect".He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.Shaq also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.Shaq rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics, and although Shaq was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster, Shaq eventually declined the invitation.He established He as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.At 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg; 24 st) and U.S.shoe size 23, he became famous for he physical stature.he physical frame gave he a power advantage over most opponents.On two occasions during His first season in the NBA, His powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.O'Neal's "drop step", (called the "Black Tornado" by O'Neal) in which O'Neal posted up a defender, turned around and, using O'Neal elbows for leverage, powered past O'Neal for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon.In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket.The ability to dunk contributed to O'Neal career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.his led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of Opposing teams own big men.O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.O'Neal's primary weakness was O'Neal free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%.O'Neal once missed all 11 of O'Neal free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.O'Neal believes O'Neal free throw woes were a mental issue, as O'Neal often shot 80 percent in practice.In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as "Hack-a-Shaq".O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken, having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season.On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed O'Neal 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.O'Neal only made one three point shot during O'Neal entire career.O'Neal made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic.He career three point shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).O'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team.O'Neal presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and O'Neal averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of O'Neal career.Phil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in Phil Jackson , saying Phil Jackson "could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons." The Lakers retired Phil Jackson No.34 jersey on April 2, 2013.On  February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that the Miami Heat would retire O'Neal's No.32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have just 32 athletes in American professional sports history jersey retired by multiple teams.The Heat eventually retired their jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.O'Neal called O'Neal "The Big Aristotle" and "Hobo Master" for O'Neal composure and insights during interviews.Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames including "Shaq", "The Diesel", "Shaq Fu", "The Big Daddy", "Superman", "The Big Agave", "The Big Cactus", "The Big Shaqtus", "The Big Galactus", "Wilt Chamberneezy", "The Big Baryshnikov", "The Real Deal", "The Big Shamrock", "The Big Leprechaun", "Shaqovic", and "The Big Conductor".Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.When O'Neal did not want to speak with the press, O'Neal employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of O'Neal cubicle, O'Neal would murmur in O'Neal low-pitched voice.During the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney.he was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.he's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; he frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the "Queens." During the 2002 victory parade, he declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California, after the Los Angeles Lakers' beat the Sacramento Kings in a tough seven game series en route to its third championship with he.O'Neal also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming.O'Neal told a reporter, "you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so." O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and O'Neal meant no offense.Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but O'Neal said a lot of Asians wouldn't see the humor.Yao joked, "Chinese is hard to learn.I had trouble with it when I was little." O'Neal later admitted that O'Neal regretted how O'Neal treated Yao early in Yao career.During the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared O'Neal poor play to Erick Dampier, a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games.The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during the 2005 NBA playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult.The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.O'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant.In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, O'Neal responded, "I'm sorry, who?" and continued to pretend that O'Neal did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.O'Neal also appeared on television on Saturday Night Live (O'Neal was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer); however, O'Neal did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted Shaq's Big Challenge, a reality show on ABC in which O'Neal challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.O'Neal was known as a versatile center, using O'Neal 7' size and speed to contain opposing players, launch precise shots from outside the paint, and finish fast breaks – the latter uncanny for a man of O'Neal stature.Fellow Hall of Famer and teammate from 1985 to 1987 Bill Walton once called Parish the "greatest shooting big man of all time", perhaps because of Parish's field goal and free throw shooting ability, an unusual talent among most centers.His trademark was His high-release jump shot, which traversed a very high arc before falling.In 1996, Parish, along with teammates Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, were each selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.In 1998, in honor of his achievements, the Celtics retired Parish's famous #00 jersey number at halftime of a Celtics–Pacers game; this

the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, His was selected to play on the USA men's basketball team coached by UNC's Dean Smith that won the gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics.In he freshman year, he hit a buzzer-beating jump shot against Duke at the end of regulation to send the game into overtime.At Chapel Hill, Davis was called "Sweet D" because of Davis seemingly effortless, smooth style of play and because of Davis strong defensive play.The Suns selected Davis with the fifth pick of the 1977 NBA draft.Davis made an immediate impact, playing in 81 games and averaging 24.2

called on to testify on illegal drug use by other the Suns players in exchange for immunity from prosecution.(he had twice entered rehab clinics to deal with cocaine addiction.)Davis's decline mirrored the short decline of the Suns franchise, and at the expiration of he contract in 1988 at age 33, the team did not seriously attempt to re-sign he, offering a 1-year contract at half he previous salary.Davis signed a two-year, $1.35 million deal with the Denver Nuggets as an unrestricted free agent.Davis ended up playing for two years beyond this contract, and was included in a three-team trade in early 1991 that sent Davis to the Portland Trail Blazers for half a season.Davis finished 479 points shy of 20,000 points in a career.In the summer of 1991, Davis returned to

the Suns relationship.In 1994, his number 6 was retired by the Suns, and in 2004 his was enshrined in the team's Ring of Honor.his is the uncle of UNC assistant coach Hubert Davis, who also played for UNC and in the NBA.his led his high school in Granite City, Illinois, to the IHSA state championship in 1940 by defeating Herrin High School with a final score of 24-22 at Huff Gym on the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign campus.Ironically it would be that same gymnasium where he earned renown for he talents and for the Fighting Illini's success during war-interrupted, non-consecutive seasons in 1941–1943 and 1946–1947.Phillip was the untitled leader of "The Whiz Kids", a team that included Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and team captain Art Mathisen.Arguably the most talented basketball team in the nation, Phillip and Phillip teammates would elect not to participate in either the NCAA or NIT tournament based on the Army's draft of Mathisen, Menke and Jack Smiley.Arguably the most talented basketball team in the nation, Phillip and his teammates was retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.Four of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to

recognizing Phillip superior performance in Phillip appearance in the tournament.Phillip died at Phillip home in Rancho Mirage, California on April 29, 2001, aged 79.Sports writer Dan Manoyan wrote a book about Phillip and Phillip Granite City High School basketball teammates, titled Men of Granite, in 2007.A film based on a book about Phillip and his Granite City High School basketball teammates,

intensity at both ends of the court, a style that never wavered during He 11-year NBA career.As a testament to his all-around ability, Cowens' is one of only five players (Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the others) to lead Cowens' team in all five major statistical categories for a season: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals.Cowens

afford to send His parents other children to college.His father worked in a paper mill until a stroke that paralyzed His father right side prevented His from walking and affected His speech.Pippen attended Hamburg High School.Playing point guard, Pippen led Pippen team to the state playoffs and earned all-conference honors as a senior.he was not offered any college scholarships.Pippen began Pippen college playing career at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway after being discovered by then-UCA Head coach Don Dyer as a 6'1" walk-on.Pippen did not receive much recognition in

and 100 blocks in a season and Pippen has the record for second most career steals in the playoffs (395) behind LeBron James.Pippen was skilled at staying in front of Pippen man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with Pippen long arms in traps.He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.On offense, Pippen relied primarily on Pippen remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over Pippen defender; Pippen slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots.Early in Pippen career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; Pippen struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket.Pippen favored shooting Pippen jump shots—mid-range and three-pointers—on an angle.He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket.He honed He jump shot over the course of He career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.He is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall.Much like fellow Chicago Bull Michael Jordan, Pippen provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender.fellow Chicago Bull Michael Jordan was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.He unusually long arms (88 in (2.2 m) wingspan) and jumping agility helped He to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass by He, to grab out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make.His often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result.Pippen was also a selfless player.Pippen team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships.Pippen's career assists total of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to His team-focused approach to the game.It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.he intense work ethic and athletic physique gave he the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk.As Pippen himself has attested, His and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points).During the 1990 Slam Dunk Contest, Pippen exhibited Pippen leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line.Pippen was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with dunks and a skillful finger roll that Pippen added to Pippen skill set over time.He was also a prolific perimeter shooter, taking about three thousand and making almost one thousand three-pointers in He career.Several NBA players have placed Pippen on Several NBA players all-time starting lineups, some of which include Jason Kidd, Michael Jordan, and Karl Malone.Although his given name is spelled Scotty on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by Scottie.Pippen stated that people usually shorten the name to Scott if it ends in y.Pippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom Pippen has a son, Antron

Porziņģis to offseason training sessions.he played in youth competition with BK Liepājas Lauvas, the most famous club based in hometown of Liepāja, until he was 15 years old.An agent from Latvia sent video of He around this time to teams in Spain and Italy.In 2010, Baloncesto Sevilla, a club that had a professional team competing in the Liga ACB in Spain, called Porziņģis for a tryout in an attempt to recruit foreign talent to Porziņģis junior squads.He stood 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and weighed 157 lbs (71 kg) at this time.Porziņģis recalled the moment and said, "I came here with my brother for two or three days, but the moment was really hot and I couldn't play at my best because of that.Still, I received a contract in summer 2010 and I signed a contract." Inmaculada Avivar, a nutritionist for Sevilla, diagnosed that Porziņģis was suffering from anemia, meaning that Porziņģis had fewer red blood cells.This caused Porziņģis to feel fatigue, shortness of breath, and inability to exercise.Nevertheless, him gradually overcame the condition and began seeing improvement in him game.In addition to he medical problems, Porziņģis had trouble picking up the language in Seville, making he reluctant to return there after he first tryout.In his first season playing for the junior squad, his struggled to communicate with the coaching staff and his teammates and was often sleepy due to his health.Porziņģis debuted for the youth squad on 4 January 2012, against Porziņģis counterpart from Barcelona, adding 12 points and 10 rebounds.The opposing side was led by Alexander Zhigulin, who would go on to enter the 2015 NBA draft and withdraw.However, Sevilla was defeated, 56–75.This game was part of the Ciutat de L'Hospitalet tournament, which led up to the Nike International Junior Tournament (NIJT).On 5 January, he scored a personal best of 16 points on the Spars Sarajevo youth squad, helping Sevilla beat their opponents by a margin of 8 points.Porziņģis said, "I knew it was a prestigious tournament and that I had to do well", Porziņģis said."I think I could have done much better, but I wasn't physically 100 percent.I have seen videos and could have been much more aggressive.But I wish I could have played better." He finished the tournament averaging 9.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.6 blocks.Porziņģis represented the Sevilla junior team again at the same tournament in early 2013.Against Union Olimpija on 4 January, Porziņģis recorded 15 points and 6 rebounds.On 6 January, in the team's tournament finale vs Real Madrid's youth squad, he scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.he also made a total of five three-pointers.Porziņģis proved to be more effective in He second year, averaging 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocks and going .481 on three-pointers.This would be Porziņģis final stint in the youth categories of Sevilla.Porziņģis played with the Latvian youth team and was selected in the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship All-Tournament Team.In 2015, Porziņģis was named the Latvian Rising Star of the Year.In 2017, Porziņģis played for Latvia at EuroBasket 2017, where Porziņģis averaged 23.6 points per game (ranked 3rd), 5.9 rebounds per game (ranked 19th) and 1.9 blocks per game (ranked 1st).Latvia was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Slovenia, losing 103–97.Porziņģis has been compared to Dirk Nowitzki, with the pair having both been groomed in Europe before entering the NBA.Both Porziņģis and Nowitzki are seven-foot-plus players who are comfortable anywhere on the front line and can Both Porziņģis and Nowitzki shoot from the outside.During his rookie season, Kevin Durant dubbed Porziņģis a basketball "unicorn" because of his rare combination of talents.In January 2018, Porziņģis was averaging 19 shot attempts per game for the Knicks, the most ever by a player his size (the only players 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m) or taller to average 15 field goal attempts per game were Ralph Sampson and Yao Ming).Due to his height and mobility, Porziņģis is able to shoot over any defender, with his sheer size and high volume creating a unique advantage shared by no other player in the league.Porziņģis was born to parents who had experience playing the game of basketball.Tālis, Tālis father, competed semi-professionally before becoming a bus driver.Tālis mother, Ingrīda, was previously on Latvia women's youth national basketball team.Kristaps's older brother, Jānis, also played professionally, while Mārtiņš, who is approximately fifteen years older than His youngest sibling, was also an avid player.In a 2017 E:60 documentary on Porziņģis' life, his parents revealed that his parents had another son, Toms, who was born four years before Kristaps and died at 14 months.Through an interpreter, Ingrīda said about Toms' death, "It felt like a bulldozer had run over my life.We had two other children who We had to care for.We had to live on.After Kristaps was born, it was like he had to live for two lives."Jānis Porziņģis competed at the European 2nd tier EuroCup level, the same level in Europe that Kristaps later played at, in one game, and played European professional club basketball in various national leagues, including the Italian League, for more than 10 years.he is known to mentor he younger brother on and off the court and often called he after playing games for Cajasol Sevilla in Spain.Kristaps talked about the relationship in an interview, "We'd break down the details.We watched the film together.He's always pushing me to work hard.We just spend a lot of time together and We just talk about basketball all the time..."

and was immediately noted for scoring 27 points against Crvena zvezda.In summer 1986, at 18, right after signing for KK Partizan, Divac debuted for the senior Yugoslavia national basketball team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Madrid, on invitation by the head coach Krešimir Ćosić.However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the Soviet Union.Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points.Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a double dribble, the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer.In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.The next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the FIBA Junior World Championship (since split into separate under-19 and under-21 events) in Bormio, Italy.That event launched the young generation of Yugoslavian basketball players, also featuring stars like Rađa and Kukoč, regarded as likely the best in history.Before the breakup of Yugoslavia, the breakup of Yugoslavia would also take the titles at EuroBasket 1989 and the 1990 FIBA World Championship in Argentina, where the breakup of Yugoslavia were led by Dražen Petrović, as well as the EuroBasket 1991 title, with Aleksandar Đorđević at point guard.When Yugoslavia won the gold in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, fans rushed onto the court.One of fans was holding a Croatian flag, one of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia.Divac claims that Divac told the man that the man should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia.Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about that flag, at which point Divac took that flag from the man.This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war.The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians.Divac has stated that Divac did not mean it as an act against Croatia and Divac would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.This action, along with the Yugoslav Wars, alienated Divac from many of Divac former Croatian friends, particularly Dražen Petrović, whom Divac considered Divac best friend.When Yugoslavia won EuroBasket 1995, and Croatia won bronze, Croatia, still at war with Serbs from Croatia, walked off the podium during the medal ceremony.The teams had not faced each other in the tournament.Through the twilight of his playing career and afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.Divac has been involved in many non-basketball endeavors while still actively playing in the NBA, and more so after Divac retired.Divac is an active restaurant investor in the Sacramento, California area.However, He attempts to make major investments in Serbia failed, for a variety of reasons.The most notable affair was a highly publicized business venture—takeover bid of profitable beverage producer Knjaz Miloš.Divac's company "Apurna", in a joint venture with French dairy giant Danone, ostensibly proposed takeover bid of profitable beverage producer Knjaz Miloš, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.In the best bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to FPP Balkan Ltd., a privatization fund from the Cayman Islands.The entire messy affair caused great friction within the Serbian government, wide speculation about corruption, resignation of the Securities Commission chief, and even a police investigation.Another similar, though less spectacular, episode happened with 2005 Divac's attempt to take over the Večernje novosti, a Serbian high-circulation daily.Divac made an agreement with small shareholders to take over the company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital.However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move.While the attempted takeover was a "backdoor" one indeed, the attempted takeover was legal and similar cases had already occurred.The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily.Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor, Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor withdrew from the contest, citing "friendly advice" by unnamed persons.Embittered, Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor decided to stop Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor attempts to invest in Serbia: "All of this is ugly and I'm very upset...I realized that there's no place for he in Serbia and my friends can meet me in Madrid from now on...In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them".However, that turned out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally registered as 100% owner of Voda Voda, a bottled water brand previously owned by businessman Vojin Đorđević.That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as businessman Vojin Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a gentlemen's agreement they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the Serbian Business Registers Agency.The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that Divac indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's Si&Si company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill Divac part of the deal, just used the contract that Divac presented to the Serbian Business Registers Agency, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.Divac is a humanitarian worker, focusing on aid to children worldwide and refugees in Divac home country.Along with six Serbian basketball teammates, Divac established the charity called Group Seven, later renamed to "Divac's Children Foundation", and works closely with International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), helping International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) to raise around US$500,000 for humanitarian assistance in Serbia since 1997.Divac's own foundation, presided by Divac wife Snežana, provided over $2,500,000 in humanitarian assistance through 1998–2007.In late 2007 Divac founded a humanitarian organization, "You Can Too" (Serbian: Можеш и ти/Možeš i ti), bent on assisting the refugees in Serbia.Serbia has around 500,000 refugees from the 1990s Yugoslav wars, making Serbia the country with the largest refugee problem in Europe.Around 7,800 of those people still live in collective centers under poor conditions, so the organization has vouched the organization to buy abandoned countryside houses, in an attempt to finally solve those people accommodation problem.From September 21 to 23, 2007, Divac organized an official farewell from active basketball career in Divac hometown Prijepolje and Belgrade, simultaneously promoting the "You Can Too" campaign.The spectacle culminated in gathering of Divac and Divac worldwide friends in front of 10,000 people outside the National Assembly building.In the early 1990s, the song "Vlade Divac" by Belgrade band Deca Loših Muzičara, devoted to Divac transfer to Lakers, was a big hit; the band finally got to personally meet Divac and perform the song with Divac on Divac farewell party in 2007.During Divac time with the Lakers, Divac's popularity and marketing potential, in addition to Divac entertaining and good-natured personality, were picked up on by the American TV industry.As a result, his appeared quite a few times on Los Angeles-based late night programmes such as The Arsenio Hall Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.In 1990, he was featured in a commercial with Laker teammates A.C.Green and Mychal Thompson for the Schick brand razors company.Green and Mychal Thompson for the Schick brand razors company also appeared in American sitcoms Married...with Children and Coach, as well as in the short lived Good Sports sitcom.On the big screen Divac took part in basketball-based movies Eddie, Space Jam and Juwanna Mann.Later in his career, his appeared on Larry King Live in 1999 and The Late Late Show in 2002.In Serbia, all throughout his playing career, Divac regularly appeared in commercials pitching products ranging from Atlas Beer to Société Générale Bank mortgage credit plans.his appeared in a national TV commercial in the United States alongside former NBA star Darryl Dawkins for Taco Bell.Divac appeared as a special guest on Eurovision 2008.Divac threw a ball into the audience, which marked the beginning of televoting.Divac features in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary Once Brothers, where Divac discusses the exploits of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s and how the Yugoslav Wars tore them apart, especially in context of Divac broken friendship with Croatian player Dražen Petrović.Divac appears in Boris Malagurski's documentary film The Weight of Chains, in which Divac talks about the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.Divac and Divac wife, Snežana, have two sons, Luka and Matija, and an adopted daughter, Petra, whose biological parents were killed by Kosovo Liberation Army snipers during the Kosovo War.Donaldson, a 7'2" center, starred at Luther Burbank High School and Washington State in the late 1970s.In his 4 seasons at WSU his averaged 8.5 points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game in 84 games.As of April 2015 his was the

played against early in he career.Donaldson joined the Dallas Mavericks in 1985.Donaldson joked with teammates that leaving the lowly, dysfunctional Clippers for the Dallas Mavericks was like dying and going to Heaven.He had He finest years while playing for the Mavericks, providing rebounding and shot-blocking to complement Dallas' star-studded line-up, which included Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Roy Tarpley, Derek Harper, Sam Perkins, and Brad Davis.Donaldson himself earned a spot on the 1988 All-Star Team during a season in which the Mavericks reached the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers.The NY Daily News named  Donaldson himself the worst All-Star player ever after a fans voting.Sadly, things fell apart for the Mavericks generally in the late 1980s and early 1990s as things core group was either traded away (like Aguirre) or squandered vast potential via personal problems (like Tarpley) and Donaldson became the target for many fans and even Donaldson teammates for the franchise's woes, making the end of Donaldson otherwise hugely successful tenure in Dallas inevitable.After brief stints with the New York Knicks (traded midway through 1991–92 for Brian Quinnett) and Utah Jazz (49 games in two seasons combined) in the early 1990s, injuries forced Donaldson into retirement from the NBA.Donaldson left the league in 1995, with

including 10 triple-doubles.he personal best might have been he line of 45 points, 23 rebounds and 10 assists vs.Indiana State in 1959.Despite his success on the court, Robertson's college career was soured by racism.In those days, southern university programs such as those of Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit black athletes, and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels."I'll never forgive Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels", Robertson told The Indianapolis Star years later.Decades after he college days, Robertson's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when, in 1998, the United States Basketball Writers Association renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy.the Oscar Robertson Trophy brought the Oscar Robertson Trophy full circle for Robertson since his had won the first two awards ever presented.After college, Robertson and Jerry West co-captained the U.S.basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics.The team, described as the greatest assemblage of amateur basketball talent ever, steamrollered the competition to win the gold medal.Robertson was a starting forward along with Purdue's Terry Dischinger, but played point guard as well.Robertson was the co-leading scorer with fellow NBA legend Jerry Lucas, as the U.S.team won its nine games by a margin of 42.4 points.Ten of the twelve college players on the American squad later played in the NBA, including Robertson as well as future Hall-of-Famers West, Lucas, and Walt Bellamy.Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in the NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker.Robertson rookie scoring average of 30.5 points per game is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of Robertson first seven seasons.Only three other players in NBA NBA have had more 30+ point per game seasons in Only three other players in the NBA career.Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today.Furthermore, Robertson is the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times.It was a feat that would not be repeated until Russell Westbrook managed to achieve It during the 2016–17 season.In addition to Russell Westbrook 1964 regular season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in Russell Westbrook career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969).his ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game) and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game).He led the league in assists six times, and at the time of He retirement, He was the NBA's all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.Robertson also set yardsticks in versatility.If He first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists.For Robertson career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that has never been approached.These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when Robertson played.In 1967–68, Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by Nate Archibald).The official scoring and assist titles went to other players the same season, however, because NBA NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the 1969–70 season.Robertson did, however, win a total of six the NBA assist titles during Robertson career.For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.Robertson is recognized by NBA as the first legitimate "big guard", paving the way for other oversized backcourt players like Magic Johnson.Furthermore, Robertson is also credited with having invented the head fake and the fadeaway jump shot, a shot which Michael Jordan later became famous for.For the Cincinnati Royals, now relocated and named the Sacramento Kings, he scored 22,009 points and 7,731 assists, and is all-time leader in both statistics for the combined the Cincinnati Royals/Kings teams.Robertson was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 28, 1980.Robertson received the "Player of the Century" award by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 2000 and was ranked third on SLAM Magazine's Top 75 NBA Players in 2003, behind fellow NBA legends Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.Furthermore, in 2006, ESPN named Robertson the second greatest point guard of all time, praising Robertson as the best post-up guard of all time and placing Robertson only behind Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson.In 2017, it was announced that a life-sized bronze sculpture of Robertson would be featured alongside other Indiana sports stars at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis' Old National Bank Sports Legends Avenue of Champions, located in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis''s sports park opening in 2018.In 1959, the Player of the Year Award was established to recognize the best college basketball player of the Year by the United States Basketball Writers Association.Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the Player of the Year Award during the NCAA Final Four.In 1998, it was renamed the Oscar Robertson Trophy in honor of the player who won the first two awards because of his outstanding career and his continuing efforts to promote the game of basketball.In 2004, an 18" bronze statue of Robertson was sculpted by world-renowned sculptor Harry Weber.Robertson is the son of Mazell and Bailey Robertson.Robertson has two brothers, Bailey Jr.and Henry.Henry remembers a tough childhood, plagued by poverty and racism.When a biography was going to be written about He in the 1990s, Robertson joked that He life had been "dull", and that He had been "married to the same woman for a long time".In 1997, Robertson donated one of Robertson kidneys to Robertson daughter Tia, who suffered lupus-related kidney failure.Robertson has been an honorary spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation ever since.In 2003, He published He own autobiography, The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game.Robertson also owns the chemical company Orchem, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.Regarding basketball, Robertson has stated that legendary Harlem Globetrotters players Marques Haynes and "clown prince" Goose Tatum were Robertson idols.Now in Robertson eighties, Robertson is long retired from playing basketball, although Robertson still follows it on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati, Robertson alma mater.his now lists woodworking as his prime hobby.Robertson adds that Robertson still could average a triple-double season in today's basketball, and that Robertson is highly skeptical that anyone else could do it (it was later done by Russell Westbrook in the 2016–17 season).On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both Oscar philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts.In August 2018, Oscar auctioned off Oscar 1971 championship ring, Hall of Fame ring, and one of Oscar Milwaukee

Navy, the family moved many times.After Robinson retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball.Robinson was 5 feet, 9 inches tall in junior high school; Robinson tried Robinson hand at basketball, but soon quit.Robinson attended Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., where Robinson's father was working as an engineer.By Robinson's father senior year in high school Robinson's father was 6 feet, 6 inches tall, weighed 175 pounds, and had not played organized basketball or attended any basketball camps.When the coach added the tall senior to the basketball team, Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches.Robinson scored 1320 on the SAT, and chose to go to the United States Naval Academy, where Robinson majored in mathematics.Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history.David Robinson chose the jersey number 50 after David Robinson idol Ralph Sampson.By the time He took the court in He first basketball game for the Navy Midshipmen men's basketball team, He had grown to 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), and over the course of He college basketball career He grew to 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m).he began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but in Robinson's final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball's two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior).In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final.Robinson played Robinson first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and Robinson senior season under former University of Georgia interim Head Coach Pete Herrmann.Upon graduation, Robinson became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the San Antonio Spurs the San Antonio Spurs had to wait two years because Robinson had to fulfill Robinson active-duty obligation with the Navy.Robinson was 6 ft.8 in.when he was admitted to the Naval Academy, two inches above the height limit, but received a waiver from the Superintendent of the Naval Academy.Robinson considered leaving the Naval Academy after Robinson second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty.Robinson decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that Robinson height would prevent Robinson from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to Robinson naval career, and might make it impossible for Robinson to receive a commission at all.As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps.As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was only required to serve an initial active-duty obligation of two years.After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.Robinson was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service.Despite the nickname "Admiral", Robinson's actual rank upon fulfilling He service commitment was Lieutenant (junior grade).Since his had not signed a contract, NBA regulations stated that Robinson could have reentered the draft after his naval service.Although there was speculation that Robinson might choose not to sign with the Spurs, Robinson agreed to move to San Antonio  for the 1989–90 season, but the Spurs the Spurs agreed to pay Robinson as much as the average of the salaries of the two highest-paid players in the league each year, or release Robinson to free agency.the Spurs the Spurs had spent the second half of the 1980s as an also-ran, bottoming out in 1988–89 with a 21–61 record, the worst in franchise history at the time.While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in Robinson rookie season.Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single season turnaround in NBA history at the time (a record the the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season).the Spurs the Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement.The Spurs advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where The Spurs lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers.Following the 1989–90 season, the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers was unanimously named the NBA rookie of the year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers entitled David Robinson's Supreme Court.The Spurs made The Spurs seven more seasons in a row.Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona.During the 1993–94 season, Robinson became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O'Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin's single-game franchise record of 63) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it.In the 1993–94 season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.Robinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 Robinson was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in Robinson quest to claim the one prize that had eluded Robinson: an NBA title.During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets.The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because The loss against the Rockets occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against Robinson chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon.By Robinson own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play.Early in the 1997 season, Robinson's dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when Robinson hurt Robinson back in the preseason.Robinson finally returned in December, but six games later broke Robinson foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season.As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record.However, Sean Elliott injury proved to be a blessing in disguise.Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with —, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft.They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in Robinson NBA career.Also, Robinson is one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).he is also one of only six players to record 70 or more points in a single game.Robinson scored 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994.Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), and Kobe Bryant (81 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game.Robinson is also noteworthy for Robinson harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan.Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Tim Duncan as willingly as Sportswriter Chris Sheridan did.Robinson was a member of the United States national team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, the 1988 Summer Olympics, 1992 Summer Olympics, and the 1996 Summer Olympics.David Robinson won the gold medal at all games except the 1988 Summer Olympics, where David Robinson won a bronze medal.Robinson married Valerie Hoggatt in 1991.They have three sons, David Jr., Corey, and Justin.Corey attended Notre Dame and was a wide receiver on the football team before ending Corey playing career in 2016 on medical advice due to multiple concussions prior to what would have been Corey senior season.Corey was very active on campus in Corey final undergraduate year, having been elected student body president in February 2016  for the 2016–17 school year.Justin, a 6'8" (2.03 m) forward in basketball and a two-time all-state selection in Texas, has attended Duke since August 2015.He was initially recruited to the Duke team as a "preferred walk-on" with the opportunity to eventually earn a scholarship, but was placed on scholarship before He arrival at Duke.Robinson identifies Robinson religious affiliation as Christian and stated that Robinson became a Christian on June 8, 1991 after being encouraged to read the Bible.In 2001, Robinson founded and funded the $9 million Carver Academy in San Antonio, a non-profit private school named for

frustration and, on one occasion, personally took  Eaton under a basket to explain that  Eaton needed to focus on protecting a basket, getting rebounds, and passing the ball to quicker guards, rather than trying to compete with smaller, quicker players in scoring.Eaton has cited Chamberlain's advice as the turning point in Eaton basketball career.Because of  Eaton lack of playing time at UCLA, few

for his shot-blocking, rebounding, and occasional "tippy toe" dunks.With the emergence of superstars Karl Malone and John Stockton, the Jazz became one of the best teams in the NBA.Eaton's stifling defense was a major factor in Utah's success.Eaton continued to rank among NBA leaders in blocked shots, leading the league in 1986–87 and 1987–88.In 1988–89, He averaged 10.3 rebounds per game

team with Ellis scoring ability.Following the conclusion of the 91-92 season, Ellis found Ellis traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Tracy Murray.As a member of the San Antonio Spurs, Ellis once again

was young, he father left he family, eventually settling in the Philippines.Rodman has many brothers and sisters: according to his father, Rodman has either 26 or 28 siblings on his father's side.However, Rodman has stated that Rodman is the oldest of a total of 47 children.After his father left, Shirley took many odd jobs to support the family, up to four at the same time.In his 1997 biography Bad As I Wanna Be, Rodman himself expresses Rodman himself feelings for his father: "I haven't seen his father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss ...I just look at it like this: Some man brought me into this world.That doesn't mean I have a father".(a father would not meet a father again until 2012.)Rodman and a father two sisters, Debra and Kim, grew up in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, at the time one of the most impoverished areas of the city.Rodman was so attached to Rodman mother that Rodman refused to move when his mother sent Rodman to a nursery when Rodman was four years old.According to Rodman, Rodman mom was more interested in Rodman two sisters, who were both considered more talented than Rodman was in basketball, and made Rodman a laughing stock whenever Rodman tagged along with both.Rodman felt generally "overwhelmed" by the all-female household.Debra and Kim would go on to become All-Americans at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F.Austin, respectively.Debra won two national titles with the Lady Techsters.While attending South Oak Cliff High School, Rodman was a gym class student of future Texas A&M basketball coach Gary Blair.Gary Blair coached Rodman's sisters Debra and Kim, winning three state championships.However, Rodman was not considered an athletic standout.According to Rodman, Rodman was "unable to hit a layup" and was listed in the high school basketball teams, but was either benched or cut from the squads.Measuring only 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) as a freshman in high school, Rodman also failed to make the high school basketball teams and was "totally devastated".After finishing school, only 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) worked as an overnight janitor at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.Rodman then experienced a sudden growth spurt and decided to try basketball again despite becoming even more withdrawn because Rodman felt odd in Rodman own body.A family friend tipped off the head coach of Cooke County College (now North Central Texas College) in Gainesville, Texas.In He single semester there, He averaged 17.6 points and 13.3 rebounds, before flunking out due to poor academic performance.After his short stint in Gainesville, his transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University, an NAIA school.There, his was a three-time NAIA All-American and led NAIA in rebounding twice (1985, 1986).In three seasons there (1983–1986), Rodman averaged 25.7 points and 15.7 rebounds, led a three-time NAIA All-American in rebounding twice and registered a .637 field goal percentage.At the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, a pre-draft camp for NBA hopefuls, three seasons there (1983–1986) won Most Valuable Player honors and caught the attention of the Detroit Pistons.During college Rodman worked at a summer youth basketball camp, where three seasons there (1983–1986) befriended camper Bryne Rich, who was shy and withdrawn due to a hunting accident in which three seasons there (1983–1986) mistakenly shot and killed three seasons there (1983–1986) best friend.The two became almost inseparable and formed a close bond.Rich invited Rodman to Rich rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches because Rodman was black.But the Riches were so grateful to Rodman for bringing the Riches son out of Rodman shell that the Riches were able to set aside the Riches prejudices.Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues Rodman, Rodman "adopted" the Riches as Rodman own in 1982 and went from the city life to "driving a tractor and messing with cows".Though Rodman credited the Riches as Rodman "surrogate family" that helped Rodman through college, as of 2013 Rodman had stopped communicating with the Rich family for reasons unknown to the Rich family.From the beginning of Rodman career Rodman was known for Rodman defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by Rodman rebounding prowess.In Detroit, his was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that his could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards.From 1991 on, Rodman established Rodman as one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years.Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record.In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992.Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by Rodman's decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense.Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed Rodman a hard worker and coachable.Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.On offense, Rodman's output was mediocre.Rodman's averaged 11.6 points per game in Rodman's second season, but Rodman's average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, Rodman's averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of Rodman's field goal attempts.He free throw shooting (lifetime average: .584) was considered a big liability: on December 29, 1997, Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks committed six intentional fouls against Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks in only three minutes, setting the record for the fastest foul out in NBA history.The intention was to force Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks to attempt free throws, which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points.However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit 9 of the 12 attempts.This was Dallas coach Don Nelson's early version of what would later develop into the famous "Hack-a-Shaq" method that would be implemented against Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard, and other poor free throw shooters.In 1996, Rodman had Rodman own MTV reality talk show called The Rodman World Tour, which featured Rodman in a series of odd-ball situations.That same year, Rodman had two appearances in releases by rock band Pearl Jam.A

the syndicated TV show Special Ops Force, playing 'Deke' Reynolds, a flamboyant but skilled ex-Army helo pilot and demolitions expert.In 2005, Rodman became the first man to pose naked for PETA's

Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St.Louis.Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St.Louis in order to be with Auerbach sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell.The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade.Not only did The owner of St Louis want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, The owner of St Louis wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics.After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.During that same draft, Boston also drafted guard K.C.Jones, Russell's former USF teammate.Thus, in one night, the Celtics managed to draft three future Hall of Famers: Russell, Jones and Heinsohn.The Russell draft-day trade was later called one of the most important trades in the history of North American sports.Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the U.S.national basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed.Russell had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but Russell was determined to play in the Olympics.He later commented that He would have participated in the high jump if He had been snubbed by the basketball team.Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the basketball team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game.The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game.Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition.Russell former USF and future Celtics teammate K.C.Jones joined C.Russell's No.6 jersey was retired by the Celtics on March 12, 1972, Besides the Celtics, Russell also wore number 6 at the University of San Francisco and for the 1956 USA Olympic Team.Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975.Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either event.After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988).Russell time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although Russell led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and Russell left in 1977 with a 162–166 record.Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, His last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.In addition, Russell ran into financial trouble.Russell had invested $250,000 in a rubber plantation in Liberia, where Russell had wanted to spend Russell retirement, but it went bankrupt.The same fate awaited He Boston restaurant called "Slade's", after which He had to default on a $90,000 government loan to purchase the outlet.The IRS discovered that Russell owed $34,430 in tax money and put a lien on Russell house.Russell became a vegetarian, took up golf and worked as a color commentator for CBS and TBS throughout the 1970s into the mid-1980s, but Russell was uncomfortable as a broadcaster.Russell later said, "The most successful television is done in eight-second thoughts, and the things I know about basketball, motivation, and people go deeper than that." On November 3, 1979, Russell hosted Saturday Night Live, in which Russell appeared in several sports-related sketches.Russell also wrote books, usually written as a joint project with a professional writer, including 1979's Second Wind.In 1986 Russell played Judge Roger Ferguson in the Miami Vice episode "The Fix" (aired March 7, 1986).After spending about a decade living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, Russell rose to prominence again at the turn of the millennium.Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, Russell convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud.Later that year, on November 17, 2006, the two-time NCAA winner Russell was recognized for Russell impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.Russell was one of five, along with John Wooden, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith and Dr.James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class.On May 20, 2007, Russell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where Russell served as Russell commencement speaker, and Russell received an honorary degree from Harvard University on June 7, 2007.On June 18, 2007, Russell was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame.Russell was also honored during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix.On February 14, 2009, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award would be renamed the "Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award" in honor of the 11-time NBA champion.The following day, during halftime of the All-Star game, Celtics captains Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen presented Russell a surprise birthday cake for Russell 75th birthday.Russell attended the final game of the Finals that year to present Russell newly christened namesake award to his newly christened namesake award winner, Kobe Bryant.Russell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.Russell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history.Russell awards and achievements include 11 NBA championships as a player with the Boston Celtics in 13 seasons (including two NBA championships as player/head coach), and Russell is credited with having raised defensive play in NBA to a new level.By winning the 1956 NCAA Championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, Russell became the first of only four players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA Championship back-to-back (the others being Henry Bibby, Magic Johnson, and Billy Thompson).Russell also won two state championships in high school.In the interim, Russell won an Olympic gold medal in 1956.Russell stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as Russell became the first black head coach in major U.S.professional sports when His succeeded Red Auerbach.In His first NBA full season (1957–58), His became the first player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat His accomplished 10 times in His 13 seasons.he's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second-highest performance ever, trailing only Chamberlain's all-time record of 55.Russell still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs.Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957).Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and Russell led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times.Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, Russell grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and Russell never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of Russell 13 post-season campaigns.Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957).In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs.St.Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs.Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs.Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963).He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds.Russell was known as one of the most clutch players in the NBA.Russell played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11–0 record.In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.On the hardwood, He was considered the consummate defensive center, noted for He unmatched defensive intensity, He stellar basketball IQ and He sheer will to win.Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds.Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled.Bill Bradley—Russell's erstwhile Knicks opponent—wrote in 2009 that Russell "was the smartest player ever to play the game [of basketball]".Bill Bradley—Russell's erstwhile Knicks opponent— also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points.He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops.However, on offense, Russell's output was limited.Russell NBA career personal averages show Russell to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center).In His 13 years, His averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that His was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, instead focusing on His tremendous defense.In His career, His won five regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards.Michael Jordan was selected three times to the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969).Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team.This took place during his last season (1969), and was the first season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected.In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the "Athlete of the Decade".Russell is universally seen as one of the best NBA players ever, and was declared "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980.For Russell achievements, Russell was named "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated in 1968.his also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996).Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999.In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Bill Russell in a quote that says, "There are two types of superstars.One makes One look good at the expense of the other guys on the floor.But there's another type who makes the players around One look better than the players around him are, and that's the type Russell was."On Saturday, February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals MVP Award would be named after Bill Russell.Russell was."On was named as a 2010 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.On June 15, 2017, Russell was announced as the inaugural recipient of the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award.Bill Russell was married to Bill Russell college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973.They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr.and Jacob.However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced.In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968, but the couple divorced in 1980.The relationship was shrouded in controversy because Anstett was white.In 1996, Russell married Russell third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until Marilyn Nault death in January 2009.Russell has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades.He older brother was the noted playwright Charlie L.Russell.In 1959, Charlie L.Russell is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, having been initiated into Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Gamma Alpha chapter while a student at University of San Francisco.On October 16, 2013,  Russell was arrested for bringing a loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun to the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.During Smith & Wesson handgun to the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball.Russell 1956 rookie contract was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy.Russell never had to work part-time.This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living.Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant.When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which Russell promptly received.For Russell promotion to coach, the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to Russell salary as a player.Although his salary as a player was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.The Celtics were the first [NBA basketball] team to draft a black player, period:… [a] guy named Chuck Cooper from Duquesne… The first team to start five black players was The Celtics The first [NBA organization] to hire a black [head] coach was the Boston Celticsand [The Celtics've] had at least five [black head-coaches] over the years.And so [Walter Brown,] the… guy that owned The CelticsThe Celtics[,] was [in addition to Auerbach for whom Russell expressed "respect" and "actual love"] another one of the fine, good, and decent human beings that I've ever encountered… When the Boston Celtics drafted Chuck Cooper and the Boston Celtics came into Washington, D.C.to sign Chuck Cooper contract, Walter Brown the owner of the team walked up to Chuck Cooper and said 'Chuck Cooper.Cooper, the Boston Celtics will never embarrass you.' That's the first thing Walter Brown the owner of the team said to Chuck Cooper.And that's the kind of guy [Brown] was.And so the Celtics—all we looked for was: 'Can guy [Brown] play?' And what we would do is—[Auerbach] trusted all guy [Brown] players—so like when guy [Brown]'d make a coaching decision, guy [Brown] could talk: guy [Brown] talked to [Bob] Cousey [who is white], guy [Brown] talked to me [black], guy [Brown] talked to [Bill] Sharman [white], guy [Brown] talked to Sam [Jones] [black]—all of us: "What do you think?".[Auerbach would] get the information from us and then make a decision based on that information and the Celtics thoughts.So us never, or at least I never, ever considered Auerbach as having ulterior motives for whatever Auerbach did.Russell refused to attend the ceremony when Russell jersey #6 was retired in 1972; Russell also refused to attend Russell induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975.While Russell still has sore feelings towards Boston, there has been something of a reconciliation; and Russell has even visited Boston regularly in recent years, something Russell never did in the years immediately after Russell retirement.When Russell originally retired, Russell demanded that Russell jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden.In 1995, the Celtics left an empty Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience.Perennially wary of what he long perceived as the racist city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave Russell approval.On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to Russell eyes.Russell thanked Chamberlain for taking Chamberlain to the limit and "making [Chamberlain] a better player" and the crowd for "allowing [Chamberlain] to be a part of The crowd lives." In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.On September 26, 2017, Russell posted a photograph of Russell to a previously unused Twitter  account in which Russell was taking a knee in solidarity with NFL players kneeling during the US national anthem.Russell wore Russell Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the image was captioned with "Proud to take a knee, and to stand tall against social injustice." In an interview with ESPN, Russell said Russell wanted NFL players kneeling during the US national anthem to know NFL players kneeling during the US national anthem weren't alone.Boston honored Russell by erecting a statue of Russell on City Hall Plaza in 2013: Russell is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships Russell helped the Celtics win.Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments.The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project.The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston.The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.Russell, Bill; McSweeny, William (1966).Go Up for Glory.Coward-McCann.Russell, Bill; Branch, Taylor (1979).Second Wind.Ballantine Books.ISBN 978-0-394-50385-1.Russell, Bill; Hilburg, Alan; Faulkner, David (2001).Russell Rules.New American Library.ISBN 0-525-94598-9.Russell, Bill; Steinberg, Alan (2009).Red and Me: My Coach, My Lifelong Friend.Harper.ISBN 978-0-06-176614-5.Goudsouzian, Aram (2010).

policeman of Polish descent who had changed the family's surname from "Galinsky".Gola was praised as a great all-around player as a high school student at La Salle College High School, where Gola led the Explorers to a Philadelphia Catholic League Championship.Gola entered La Salle a year after another Philadelphia basketball Hall of Famer, Paul Arizin, graduated from Villanova.Gola was one of the most talented collegiate athletes in Philadelphia sports history.Gola came to national attention while playing for the hometown La Salle University Explorers men's basketball team.Gola starred as a college freshman and led La Salle University to the 1952 NIT championship.Gola paced the Explorers to the 1952 NIT championship in 1954 and was named Tournament MVP.That same season  Gola was selected as National Player of the Year.As a senior, Gola helped La Salle finish as the runner-up in the 1955 NCAA Tournament.At 6'6" (198 cm), Gola was clearly a forward who could shoot/score, rebound and defend, but Gola also had the ballhandling (dribbling, passing) skills of a guard, and with Gola shooting range and All-Pro defensive skills, could play just as well in the backcourt.Gola averaged 20.9 points and 19.0 rebounds during 115 games and remains the NCAA All time rebounding leader with 2,201 career rebounds.He was inducted into the La Salle Hall of Athletes in 1961 and the Big 5 Hall of Fame in 1986.In 1977, Tom Gola was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.Tom Gola was listed on "ESPN's Countdown to the Greatest" College basketball players as #17.After a phenomenal college career, Gola turned pro with the Philadelphia Warriors as a territorial draft pick.Gola teamed with All-Pros Paul Arizin and Neil Johnston to lead the Philadelphia Warriors the Philadelphia Warriors to an NBA championship in 1956.He gained praise for concentrating on defense, passing and rebounding and allowing the other two to be the chief scorers during these years.In 1959, Johnston temporarily retired due to a knee injury and the Warriors added seven-foot superstar Wilt Chamberlain.Again sacrificing seven-foot superstar Wilt Chamberlain for seven-foot superstar Wilt Chamberlain team, Gola helped the Warriors the Warriors consistently reach the NBA Playoffs, but Gola could not beat the star-studded Boston Celtics in the NBA Eastern Division during seven-foot superstar Wilt Chamberlain seasons in the early 1960s even with Chamberlain.During the 1959–60 season, Gola became the first Warrior to have three straight games with a triple-double (the only other being Draymond Green, 2016).Gola played with the New York Knicks from 1962 to 1966.Gola was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 26, 1976.In 1968, Gola returned to He

named after He.In 1968, Gola was elected to the Pennsylvania State House, as a Republican, representing the Northeast Philadelphia-based 170th District.A change to the State Constitution made earlier that year had reorganized the Pennsylvania State House seats into legislative districts, replacing the old system of allotting seats on an at-large, county-wide basis.This made Gola the first person to represent the newly created district.Ultimately, Gola would not finish-out Gola first term in the House, opting instead to seek the office of Philadelphia City Controller in 1969.Gola scored an 80,000 vote victory over Democrat Charles Peruto in the general election, and took office the following January.Gola was defeated, however, in He bid for a second term in 1973 by Democrat William Klenk.Gola defeat was part of a broader setback for Republicans in the city that year, as Arlen Specter lost Arlen Specter bid for a third term as District Attorney.Gola made Gola final attempt at elected office in 1983, when Gola sought the office of Mayor.Gola came in last in the three-man field Republican primary, behind Congressman Charlie Dougherty and the winner, John Egan, who went on to lose the fall general election to Wilson Goode.Gola was married to Caroline Norris in June 1955, and they had one son Thomas Christopher.Gola died on January 26, 2014, thirteen days after Gola 81st birthday, in Meadowbrook, Pennsylvania.A former US Army specialist, A former US Army specialist was buried at the Washington Crossing National Cemetery in Upper Makefield Township, Bucks County,

stopping when Green was running or working out.Reportedly, Green never slept more than two hours at a time due to the condition.Green has since recovered.In 2011, He was awarded the Bobby Jones Award by Athletes in Action for character, leadership, and faith in the world of basketball, in the home and the community.Green's humanitarian efforts earned he a spot in the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.In 2015, Green was a judge for the 2015 Boost Mobile NBA D-League Slam Dunk Contest.In 2017, Green signed to be the Director of Sports for the United Basketball Alliance of India.Green

as the team's center.His performance in this position enabled the Warriors' to create a number of match-up problems for opposing defenses during the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons.When played as a center, Green's length and strength allow His to credibly defend and contest opposing centers in the post, though His does give up some rebounding ability against taller opponents.On the offensive

2016-17 season, thanks to the addition of former MVP Kevin Durant, his took a step forward on defense, finally winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award that his coveted after two straight seasons as runner-up to Kawhi Leonard.his is widely viewed as the emotional and motivational "heart and soul" of the Warriors and is noted for his vocal leadership on the court and in the locker room.As the Warriors pushed to the close of a record-setting 2015–16 season, Green was vocal about he desire to break the Chicago Bulls' all-time wins record, and sought the input of he teammates to make sure the team successfully pushed toward the goal together.Green and Curry's on-court chemistry has been cited as a key to the Warriors' improvement in 2015–16, as Green's outspoken, fiery desire has meshed with Curry's quieter, implacable confidence to give the team "dual—and at times dueling—alpha dogs" that are ultimately mutually supporting.Green is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of Kevin Durant to join the Warriors'.Because of his highly physical play, including multiple high-profile incidents of physical play in the playoffs, some have criticized his as being a 'dirty' player.Green is frequently among the league leaders in technical fouls.Green is the son of Mary Babers and Wallace Davis.the son of Mary Babers and Wallace Davis stepfather is Green,

expensive to live in San Francisco as most of Green Warriors teammates did and explained Green choice of a modest apartment: "I've been pretty broke my entire life.I'm not going to live my entire life, but I'm going to keep those same principles." Green identifies Green as a Christian.On September 14, 2015, Green donated $3.1 million to Michigan State University, which is the largest pledge from an athlete in the school's history, to help build a new athletics facility and fund an endowment program for scholarships.On July 10, 2016, Green was arrested for assault in East Lansing, Michigan.The night prior, he had a confrontation with Michigan

a Little Leaguer, Dennis Wayne Johnson learned basketball from Dennis Wayne Johnson father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with Dennis Wayne Johnson peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Dennis Wayne Johnson measured just 5'9" and played only "a minute or two each game".After high school, Johnson worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with Johnson brothers in summer league games after work.During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3", and developed what some later described as "rocket launcher legs", which enabled Johnson to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents.Jim White, the coach at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked Johnson to enroll.Johnson gave up Johnson jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title.However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years.At the end of Johnson junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University.Johnson chose the latter, and in Johnson only year there, Johnson averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense.After his only year there, Johnson made Johnson eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take Johnson.NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.In 1,100 games, Johnson scored 15,535 points, grabbed 4,249 rebounds and gave 5,499 assists, translating to career averages of 14.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.Known as a defensive stalwart, Johnson was elected into nine straight All-Defensive First or Second Teams.NBA legend George Gervin said in a podcast with journalist Bill Simmons that Johnson was the hardest defender he ever played against.Johnson is also acknowledged by NBA as a "money player" who was clutch in decisive moments, such as scoring 32 points for Johnson team in a Game 4 overtime victory in the 1979 NBA Finals, playing smothering defense on Magic Johnson in the 1984 NBA Finals, and converting a last-second layup in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals after a Larry Bird steal.Furthermore, Magic Johnson is lauded by the NBA as a versatile all-around weapon who played with "contagious competitiveness" and was known for Magic Johnson durability: in 14 NBA seasons, Magic Johnson played in 1,100 of a possible 1,148 games and participated in 180 playoff games, the latter figure the 11th highest number of all time.At Magic Johnson retirement, Magic Johnson was only the 11th the NBA player to amass more than 15,000 points and 5,000 assists.On December 13, 1991, the Celtics franchise retired Magic Johnson number 3 jersey.Johnson said Johnson would always be a Boston Celtic, and remarked that seeing Johnson number in the rafters gave Johnson a "special feeling".However, Johnson did not live to see an induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, a fact that has been a considerable point of debate with sports journalists.Bill Simmons of ESPN called Bill Simmons of ESPN Hall of Fame snub an "ongoing injustice", stating that according to Johnson, Joe Dumars – a Hall of Famer known for strong defense rather than spectacular scoring, like Johnson – was no better [a basketball player] than Johnson –.Colleague Ken Shouler called Johnson "one of the first guys I'd give a Hall [of Fame] pass".Contemporary Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward Larry Bird gave Johnson ultimate praise, calling Johnson the best teammate Johnson ever had in Johnson autobiography Drive, which is especially significant considering Bird's teammates included Hall of Famers Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Bill Walton, and Tiny Archibald.On April 3, 2010, ESPN Boston reported that Johnson was posthumously elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.This was officially confirmed two days later when the Basketball Hall of Fame released the list of 2010 inductees.On October 26, 2007, a learning center was dedicated in Johnson's name in the Central Branch of the YMCA of Greater Boston.a learning center was made possible by the donations and effort of Larry Bird and M.L.Carr.Johnson's family, Danny Ainge, Carr, and members of the YMCA and local community were present for the ribbon cutting ceremony.Johnson said on behalf of Johnson husband, "If Dennis were alive Dennis would really appreciate the thought and love the idea of the Learning Center."The NBA D-League Coach of the Year award is named after Johnson.Donna Johnson was married to Donna, Donna Johnson wife of 31 years, and had three children named Dwayne, Denise, and Daniel.Dennis Johnson was also known for Dennis Johnson appearance: Dennis Johnson had freckles and red-tinged hair.Dennis's brother, Joey, is a former Arizona State Sun Devils basketball star.Johnson's nephews are Nick, who appeared in 37 games with the 2014–15 Houston Rockets after being drafted by Johnson's nephews in the 2nd Round of the 2014 NBA draft, and Chris, who appeared

"Corner Club." a tavern on north Main Street in Moscow, Johnson was challenged by its owner, Herm Goetz (1925–93), to demonstrate Johnson outstanding jumping ability to the assembled patrons.the "Corner Club was a modest establishment with minimal furnishings, converted to a bar in 1948 from a small white stucco chapel with hardwood floors and substantial beams on the "Corner Club ceiling.From a standing start near the front bar, Johnson leapt to touch a spot on a beam 11 ft 6 in (3.51 m) above the floor level.a spot a beam 11 ft 6 in (3.51 m) above the floor level was marked with a ceremonial nail by Goetz, who next proclaimed that anyone who could duplicate that leap could drink for free, something that Johnson knew was highly improbable.A 40-inch (1 m) diameter circle was painted on the floor below the beam, and any potential duplicator of the leap had to have both feet on the floor, within A 40-inch (1 m) diameter circle, to ensure a standing start.Twenty-three years elapsed, with a considerable number attempts to touch Johnson's Nail, including some by the 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) UCLA All-American Bill Walton during the summer of 1984.But not even Walton, then a pro at age 31, could touch that high up ("...too much pizza and beer tonight..").That was until late January 1986, when the team bus of College of Southern Idaho, a junior college in Twin Falls, stopped in Moscow en route to a game against North Idaho College in Coeur d'Alene.Joey Johnson, the younger brother of the NBA star Dennis Johnson, was brought into the closed bar by his coaches for a try, before opening time.The 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) guard had already recorded a remarkable 48-inch (1.22 m) vertical leap during basketball practice.Johnson laced up Johnson game shoes and touched "The Nail" on Johnson first try, but this attempt was disqualified because Johnson did not start with both feet inside the given circle.this attempt came from a legal static start, but was slightly short.On His third try, His leaped, grabbed, and bent the legendary nail, a landmark event in local sports history.Goetz next pulled "The Nail" out of "The Nail" beam, and Goetz pounded its beam back in, a half inch (1 cm) higher.A 1985 graduate of Banning High School in Los Angeles, Goetz led CSI to the national junior college title in 1987 and also won the national JC title in the high jump twice.Joey Johnson transferred to Arizona State, where Joey Johnson vertical leap grew to 52 inches (1.32 m) and Joey Johnson was known as "Jumpin' Joey."  Joey Johnson played for the Sun Devils during the 1987–88 season, and won an elevated slam dunk contest at 11 ft 7 in (3.53 m) in 1990, earning $50,000.Following Gus Johnson's death in 1987, flowers were found hanging from The Nail.Due to road reconstruction on north Main Street (the widening and straightening of the couplet for US-95 north), the entire original (west) portion of the Corner Club was demolished in January 1991.Unfortunately, the condemned portion of the establishment included the original location of "The Nail."  The back (east) addition, built in 1981 of cinder blocks, was left standing.The Corner Club, at the northeast corner of "A" and Main Streets, opened for business in July 1948 and had staved off The Corner Club demolition for over a decade; The Corner Club was targeted for removal for the traffic revision since the late 1970s.In 2005, The Corner Club was listed by Sports Illustrated as one of the best sports bars in the nation.
